f0001_us_f0001_00001.wav	the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas.
f0001_us_f0001_00002.wav	along with all the other reference that I had
f0001_us_f0001_00003.wav	I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
f0001_us_f0001_00004.wav	I would always examine the patient.
f0001_us_f0001_00005.wav	Well we like to play with stuff.
f0001_us_f0001_00006.wav	to make a good living.
f0001_us_f0001_00007.wav	this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north.
f0001_us_f0001_00008.wav	we are going to be the next generation
f0001_us_f0001_00009.wav	Buildings are becoming bundles of services.
f0001_us_f0001_00010.wav	And that's what happened at the end of that three month period.
f0001_us_f0001_00011.wav	which is right next to the sun.
f0001_us_f0001_00012.wav	Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
f0001_us_f0001_00013.wav	I just want to turn to a few of them.
f0001_us_f0001_00014.wav	if you want to become more compassionate
f0001_us_f0001_00015.wav	So it's not about devaluing
f0001_us_f0001_00016.wav	whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth.
f0001_us_f0001_00017.wav	And they do some tests and figure out that
f0001_us_f0001_00018.wav	that's pretty amazing.
f0001_us_f0001_00019.wav	These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there
f0001_us_f0001_00020.wav	I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation
f0001_us_f0001_00021.wav	your position in life comes to seem not accidental
f0001_us_f0001_00022.wav	Or to put it  slightly differently
f0001_us_f0001_00023.wav	particularly when we have people thinking in groups.
f0001_us_f0001_00024.wav	but we also get to see the whole thing.
f0001_us_f0001_00025.wav	it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it.
f0001_us_f0001_00026.wav	but I'm sure Najmuddin and his friends
f0001_us_f0001_00027.wav	and I would do it again.
f0001_us_f0001_00028.wav	three tribes led by the Lakota chief Red Cloud attacked and defeated the U.S.
f0001_us_f0001_00029.wav	So that's what Lauren did.
f0001_us_f0001_00030.wav	As history points out
f0001_us_f0001_00031.wav	And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.
f0001_us_f0001_00032.wav	as long as you can keep net neutrality in place.
f0001_us_f0001_00033.wav	then we couldn't use it in the video.
f0001_us_f0001_00034.wav	and that lesson will stick with them.
f0001_us_f0001_00035.wav	They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
f0001_us_f0001_00036.wav	who were also interested in exploring that conversation.
f0001_us_f0001_00037.wav	What we need is information.
f0001_us_f0001_00038.wav	And if you open the newspaper any day of the week
f0001_us_f0001_00039.wav	You can imagine what something like this might look like five
f0001_us_f0001_00040.wav	look at religion and do the communal bit.
f0001_us_f0001_00041.wav	Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.
f0001_us_f0001_00042.wav	Which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.
f0001_us_f0001_00043.wav	And now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.
f0001_us_f0001_00044.wav	he actually did lost wax casting  in bronze for me
f0001_us_f0001_00045.wav	when we think about failure
f0001_us_f0001_00046.wav	he's full of problems
f0001_us_f0001_00047.wav	When you get dementia
f0001_us_f0001_00048.wav	expecting to find a revision worth noting.
f0001_us_f0001_00049.wav	I didn't know where my corners were
f0001_us_f0001_00050.wav	You've got to come up and see them.
f0001_us_f0001_00051.wav	that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper.
f0001_us_f0001_00052.wav	if you dyed your hair black
f0001_us_f0001_00053.wav	But the over-eating and over-drinking
f0001_us_f0001_00054.wav	Snobbery is a global phenomenon.
f0001_us_f0001_00055.wav	they're bashing up against each other.
f0001_us_f0001_00056.wav	This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.
f0001_us_f0001_00057.wav	So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism.
f0001_us_f0001_00058.wav	they will leave the elementary schools saying
f0001_us_f0001_00059.wav	And this is what we first got back from the very first set of submissions.
f0001_us_f0001_00060.wav	I don't need to go into that.
f0001_us_f0001_00061.wav	So if we zoom in to an even deeper level
f0001_us_f0001_00062.wav	It was like something out of Caligula.
f0001_us_f0001_00063.wav	if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school.
f0001_us_f0001_00064.wav	It's one continuous processing unit
f0001_us_f0001_00065.wav	And I am going to suggest that this is a good thing.
f0001_us_f0001_00066.wav	What did you do with the other child
f0001_us_f0001_00067.wav	Many of those patients are very severely burned.
f0001_us_f0001_00068.wav	but on the content of their character
f0001_us_f0001_00069.wav	and wasichu is a Lakota word that means non-Indian
f0001_us_f0001_00070.wav	They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.
f0001_us_f0001_00071.wav	domestic violence and general apathy
f0001_us_f0001_00072.wav	that's not quite right.
f0001_us_f0001_00073.wav	They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier
f0001_us_f0001_00074.wav	looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.
f0001_us_f0001_00075.wav	we knew that it was political.
f0001_us_f0001_00076.wav	And what we're finding is actually
f0001_us_f0001_00077.wav	But there's actually a lot of structure there.
f0001_us_f0001_00078.wav	wealthy country in the world.
f0001_us_f0001_00079.wav	We need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet.
f0001_us_f0001_00080.wav	And that gave women the right to vote.
f0001_us_f0001_00081.wav	I come out of the advertising and design business.
f0001_us_f0001_00082.wav	That is an unknown part of them.
f0001_us_f0001_00083.wav	the conversation changes depending upon who's sitting around the table.
f0001_us_f0001_00084.wav	her son donated all of his toys to her
f0001_us_f0001_00085.wav	with all these sandbags at the windows.
f0001_us_f0001_00086.wav	anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have.
f0001_us_f0001_00087.wav	Well what do you want to write
f0001_us_f0001_00088.wav	So here we have this triangle
f0001_us_f0001_00089.wav	I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital
f0001_us_f0001_00090.wav	nor is it the most intelligent that survives
f0001_us_f0001_00091.wav	It's not all perfect yet.
f0001_us_f0001_00092.wav	If the horse was in pain
f0001_us_f0001_00093.wav	all the mothers that give life
f0001_us_f0001_00094.wav	put into the atmosphere
f0001_us_f0001_00095.wav	and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.
f0001_us_f0001_00096.wav	it is the one that is most adaptable to change.
f0001_us_f0001_00097.wav	or might have looked like
f0001_us_f0001_00098.wav	You can see this is a major shipping airport
f0001_us_f0001_00099.wav	so I guess I'd better go play video games or get into sports
f0001_us_f0001_00100.wav	You encounter it within minutes at a party
f0001_us_f0001_00101.wav	or I've got to do sports.
f0001_us_f0001_00102.wav	then you know that Pine Ridge is ground zero for Native issues in the U.S.
f0001_us_f0001_00103.wav	And if we're going to really
f0001_us_f0001_00104.wav	if you happen to be poor
f0001_us_f0001_00105.wav	the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created
f0001_us_f0001_00106.wav	And that is all you have to do.
f0001_us_f0001_00107.wav	So we have to have a change in consciousness.
f0001_us_f0001_00108.wav	which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin
f0001_us_f0001_00109.wav	you don't want to watch.
f0001_us_f0001_00110.wav	organized the document
f0001_us_f0001_00111.wav	Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific
f0001_us_f0001_00112.wav	an Argentine composer.
f0001_us_f0001_00113.wav	And then what we get is our first mapping.
f0001_us_f0001_00114.wav	so there's nothing feminine about feminism.
f0001_us_f0001_00115.wav	We need to think about how to uncompress this curriculum if we can
f0001_us_f0001_00116.wav	the machine acting upon the band members
f0001_us_f0001_00117.wav	but it's always with me.
f0001_us_f0001_00118.wav	I would like to ask you to re-frame that.
f0001_us_f0001_00119.wav	Have you seen the ads
f0001_us_f0001_00120.wav	And Mahmoud was coming every day.
f0001_us_f0001_00121.wav	And we'll call this a wheel.
f0001_us_f0001_00122.wav	So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.
f0001_us_f0001_00123.wav	we weren't our American selves
f0001_us_f0001_00124.wav	You have to be generous
f0001_us_f0001_00125.wav	they make their livings on this kind of stuff.
f0001_us_f0001_00126.wav	I was worried because I was breaking the rules.
f0001_us_f0001_00127.wav	there are words that we just don't want to hear.
f0001_us_f0001_00128.wav	and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.
f0001_us_f0001_00129.wav	then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics
f0001_us_f0001_00130.wav	told them they were A's
f0001_us_f0001_00131.wav	This is that great big secret.
f0001_us_f0001_00132.wav	Now what I learned from her
f0001_us_f0001_00133.wav	and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
f0001_us_f0001_00134.wav	MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans.
f0001_us_f0001_00135.wav	It costs about the same to produce a new drug
f0001_us_f0001_00136.wav	And the cycle continues
f0001_us_f0001_00137.wav	Why does that sense of mystery
f0001_us_f0001_00138.wav	And they're always talking about this stuff.
f0001_us_f0001_00139.wav	I spent a lot of time at airport security.
f0001_us_f0001_00140.wav	And we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school
f0001_us_f0001_00141.wav	which happens right here.
f0001_us_f0001_00142.wav	I was able to stone one adulterer.
f0001_us_f0001_00143.wav	And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
f0001_us_f0001_00144.wav	and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
f0001_us_f0001_00145.wav	And I think every human
f0001_us_f0001_00146.wav	it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
f0001_us_f0001_00147.wav	Sex With Mum Was Blinding  In a way
f0001_us_f0001_00148.wav	And a record executive walked up to me and invited me to Nashville
f0001_us_f0001_00149.wav	But if we're serious people
f0001_us_f0001_00150.wav	and they try to find hot spots of activity that are linked causally to genes.
f0001_us_f0001_00151.wav	I guess this really isn't a place for boys.
f0001_us_f0001_00152.wav	but because the whole visit was now about the physical
f0001_us_f0001_00153.wav	We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.
f0001_us_f0001_00154.wav	but most people haven't.
f0001_us_f0001_00155.wav	You can't pick individual sheep
f0001_us_f0001_00156.wav	My own theory of success
f0001_us_f0001_00157.wav	I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.
f0001_us_f0001_00158.wav	It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist
f0001_us_f0001_00159.wav	But this isn't even about Reddit itself.
f0001_us_f0001_00160.wav	But at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us
f0001_us_f0001_00161.wav	was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail.
f0001_us_f0001_00162.wav	And would you want to meet that poor
f0001_us_f0001_00163.wav	we would have to generate an absolutely astonishing amount of energy.
f0001_us_f0001_00164.wav	And can we afford not to
f0001_us_f0001_00165.wav	we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions.
f0001_us_f0001_00166.wav	then you can start finding ways to see things.
f0001_us_f0001_00167.wav	maybe it's too simple.
f0001_us_f0001_00168.wav	There are simply too  many random factors.
f0001_us_f0001_00169.wav	and we did exactly that.
f0001_us_f0001_00170.wav	And I think that we will.
f0001_us_f0001_00171.wav	and they're in violent motion.
f0001_us_f0001_00172.wav	Now we may find that there are places that are really
f0001_us_f0001_00173.wav	No need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair.
f0001_us_f0001_00174.wav	that thou shall have reverence.
f0001_us_f0001_00175.wav	The Japanese government called off  their whaling expedition.
f0001_us_f0001_00176.wav	not just that religion is wrong
f0001_us_f0001_00177.wav	We need to do it for our own economy.
f0001_us_f0001_00178.wav	Now the word propaganda sets off alarm bells.
f0001_us_f0001_00179.wav	I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament.
f0001_us_f0001_00180.wav	I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year.
f0001_us_f0001_00181.wav	so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
f0001_us_f0001_00182.wav	most people are not our mothers.
f0001_us_f0001_00183.wav	transit systems that actually work to transport people
f0001_us_f0001_00184.wav	Dignity cannot wait for better times.
f0001_us_f0001_00185.wav	which potential do we want to bring out
f0001_us_f0001_00186.wav	people are either incredibly delighted to see you
f0001_us_f0001_00187.wav	If you talk to faculty
f0001_us_f0001_00188.wav	but we managed to reach the shelter.
f0001_us_f0001_00189.wav	find interesting things out with this.
f0001_us_f0001_00190.wav	So I teamed up with my good friend Ricardo Cabello
f0001_us_f0001_00191.wav	This is a project called Flight Patterns.
f0001_us_f0001_00192.wav	I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.
f0001_us_f0001_00193.wav	then I examine the hands
f0001_us_f0001_00194.wav	So we did exactly that.
f0001_us_f0001_00195.wav	Working with Larry Lessig
f0001_us_f0001_00196.wav	and I was never as loving.
f0001_us_f0001_00197.wav	I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity
f0001_us_f0001_00198.wav	It's the rewards we want.
f0001_us_f0001_00199.wav	under business as usual.
f0001_us_f0001_00200.wav	That means we get our new hips for free.
f0001_us_f0001_00201.wav	Let me show you these slides here.
f0001_us_f0001_00202.wav	It's seen as hypocrisy.
f0001_us_f0001_00203.wav	it's only God who can really put everybody in their place.
f0001_us_f0001_00204.wav	the article was called
f0001_us_f0001_00205.wav	and it's paradoxical because it's linked to something that's rather nice
f0001_us_f0001_00206.wav	This is the blood vessels.
f0001_us_f0001_00207.wav	where we're all plugged into this borg
f0001_us_f0001_00208.wav	what we ought to do is take a page from their playbook
f0001_us_f0001_00209.wav	reins in the question-asking  in the hopes of them being polite little kids.
f0001_us_f0001_00210.wav	I remember so many huge
f0001_us_f0001_00211.wav	That's a production line and a very fast one.
f0001_us_f0001_00212.wav	The closer two people are
f0001_us_f0001_00213.wav	Children are the messages that we send to the future.
f0001_us_f0001_00214.wav	but we can admire the institutional way in which they're doing it.
f0001_us_f0001_00215.wav	and I started to cry.
f0001_us_f0001_00216.wav	truly become sustainable cities
f0001_us_f0001_00217.wav	fumbling with his buttons.
f0001_us_f0001_00218.wav	And I collected a lot
f0001_us_f0001_00219.wav	Now we don't think that way.
f0001_us_f0001_00220.wav	and he was starting  the real physical rehabilitation.
f0001_us_f0001_00221.wav	We could hear in the air the bullets passing.
f0001_us_f0001_00222.wav	coronary artery disease.
f0001_us_f0001_00223.wav	The key is to pick and choose the right parts.
f0001_us_f0001_00224.wav	It sprayed everywhere.
f0001_us_f0001_00225.wav	in his sword swallowing act.
f0001_us_f0001_00226.wav	If everybody on the planet lived the way we did
f0001_us_f0001_00227.wav	those larger markets I was talking about earlier
f0001_us_f0001_00228.wav	haunted eyes staring up at me as I performed this ritual.
f0001_us_f0001_00229.wav	which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.
f0001_us_f0001_00230.wav	don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management.
f0001_us_f0001_00231.wav	Interesting where it came from.
f0001_us_f0001_00232.wav	And I started making these
f0001_us_f0001_00233.wav	instead of in brain research
f0001_us_f0001_00234.wav	Larger markets increase the incentive  to produce all kinds of ideas.
f0001_us_f0001_00235.wav	It's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he's going to fail.
f0001_us_f0001_00236.wav	I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.
f0001_us_f0001_00237.wav	to have a new means of operating.
f0001_us_f0001_00238.wav	What do organized religions do
f0001_us_f0001_00239.wav	and it's not as hard as you think.
f0001_us_f0001_00240.wav	how much waste is left behind you.
f0001_us_f0001_00241.wav	is the hope we all have for our careers.
f0001_us_f0001_00242.wav	The lyrics to the leading track are Ain't no grave can hold my body down.
f0001_us_f0001_00243.wav	There are the heart patches.
f0001_us_f0001_00244.wav	After three and a half hours
f0001_us_f0001_00245.wav	or a person who's empowered
f0001_us_f0001_00246.wav	Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
f0001_us_f0001_00247.wav	And another engineer thought
f0001_us_f0001_00248.wav	And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you're eating Doritos.
f0001_us_f0001_00249.wav	They're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
f0001_us_f0001_00250.wav	we lose interest in banking.
f0001_us_f0001_00251.wav	Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society.
f0001_us_f0001_00252.wav	the scientists wanted to say
f0001_us_f0001_00253.wav	The nerdy side of me thought
f0001_us_f0001_00254.wav	starting a little bit later
f0001_us_f0001_00255.wav	So religions are cultures of repetition.
f0001_us_f0001_00256.wav	Running through this typical letter that they had
f0001_us_f0001_00257.wav	Let me read you the entry.
f0001_us_f0001_00258.wav	put a bio-degradable material on there
f0001_us_f0001_00259.wav	died at the age of nine on Christmas Eve after a brief illness.
f0001_us_f0001_00260.wav	And if you shortchange that ritual by not undressing the patient
f0001_us_f0001_00261.wav	And if there's anything that's been learned about burn
f0001_us_f0001_00262.wav	then I look at the nail beds
f0001_us_f0001_00263.wav	com you can actually hear what all this sounds like together.
f0001_us_f0001_00264.wav	or any of my sports victories
f0001_us_f0001_00265.wav	I've had some great meals at cafeterias.
f0001_us_f0001_00266.wav	and it's a serious problem with boys.
f0001_us_f0001_00267.wav	where the element of loss is.
f0001_us_f0001_00268.wav	But the damage had been done.
f0001_us_f0001_00269.wav	And those genes are interesting
f0001_us_f0001_00270.wav	It's perhaps easier now
f0001_us_f0001_00271.wav	But the volumes are much larger than ever.
f0001_us_f0001_00272.wav	but you weren't born with this notion
f0001_us_f0001_00273.wav	in the middle of the Atlantic
f0001_us_f0001_00274.wav	but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them
f0001_us_f0001_00275.wav	So just imagine that for a moment.
f0001_us_f0001_00276.wav	Your link is just as good as your link
f0001_us_f0001_00277.wav	if we pay attention to these things
f0001_us_f0001_00278.wav	this is today's clean coal technology.
f0001_us_f0001_00279.wav	We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
f0001_us_f0001_00280.wav	I want to imagine that
f0001_us_f0001_00281.wav	But it's happening all over the place
f0001_us_f0001_00282.wav	And as we collect more and more personally and socially relevant data
f0001_us_f0001_00283.wav	These are concentrating  solar renewable-energy plants
f0001_us_f0001_00284.wav	Why do you hate writing
f0001_us_f0001_00285.wav	we have open source software
f0001_us_f0001_00286.wav	his genitals were masculinzed
f0001_us_f0001_00287.wav	This is a global phenomenon.
f0001_us_f0001_00288.wav	We get so little news about the developing world
f0001_us_f0001_00289.wav	but she's not getting her period
f0001_us_f0001_00290.wav	is servicing this one organ.
f0001_us_f0001_00291.wav	We make something over here
f0001_us_f0001_00292.wav	And I'm going to finish up with a quote
f0001_us_f0001_00293.wav	And we learned that small stuff stinks.
f0001_us_f0001_00294.wav	And that tissue falls off.
f0001_us_f0001_00295.wav	except they're right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs.
f0001_us_f0001_00296.wav	And it's sort of evolved.
f0001_us_f0001_00297.wav	And speaking of synchronization
f0001_us_f0001_00298.wav	while as a journalist
f0001_us_f0001_00299.wav	All of the markers went in the right direction.
f0001_us_f0001_00300.wav	and what was being done to her son
f0001_us_f0001_00301.wav	not the difference in anatomy
f0001_us_f0001_00302.wav	and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl
f0001_us_f0001_00303.wav	And you can sort the video a number of different ways.
f0001_us_f0001_00304.wav	You also have growth management.
f0001_us_f0001_00305.wav	What are you doing out in the street in this situation
f0001_us_f0001_00306.wav	And each gene gives us a fingerprint.
f0001_us_f0001_00307.wav	This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.
f0001_us_f0001_00308.wav	if you're a speaker here
f0001_us_f0001_00309.wav	the beating heart of the global climate system.
f0001_us_f0001_00310.wav	The people in the modern world
f0001_us_f0001_00311.wav	These are two genes that we found as good examples.
f0001_us_f0001_00312.wav	inspirational musicians around the world.
f0001_us_f0001_00313.wav	So this is a bypass operation
f0001_us_f0001_00314.wav	and what some of the hurdles are.
f0001_us_f0001_00315.wav	This compressed curriculum is bad for all active kids.
f0001_us_f0001_00316.wav	because to show that you truly care
f0001_us_f0001_00317.wav	And each gene gives us a fingerprint.
f0001_us_f0001_00318.wav	They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins.
f0001_us_f0001_00319.wav	counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook
f0001_us_f0001_00320.wav	specifically not the other way around.
f0001_us_f0001_00321.wav	I got the right profiles.
f0001_us_f0001_00322.wav	Luke Fildes was commissioned to paint this by Tate
f0001_us_f0001_00323.wav	Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations
f0001_us_f0001_00324.wav	this would be somebody who's completely logical.
f0001_us_f0001_00325.wav	maybe a little bit of asthma.
f0001_us_f0001_00326.wav	A Force More Powerful is a video game that
f0001_us_f0001_00327.wav	And they threw up walls
f0001_us_f0001_00328.wav	And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities
f0001_us_f0001_00329.wav	Because I believe that the best is yet to come.
f0001_us_f0001_00330.wav	And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over.
f0001_us_f0001_00331.wav	And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.
f0001_us_f0001_00332.wav	by listening with your stethoscope on top of the nightgown
f0001_us_f0001_00333.wav	whether you are from the technology
f0001_us_f0001_00334.wav	But you didn't need it to describe the large
f0001_us_f0001_00335.wav	And then here's a really
f0001_us_f0001_00336.wav	That's a very new situation.
f0001_us_f0001_00337.wav	such that it has a different right than a fetal life.
f0001_us_f0001_00338.wav	As Mahatma Gandhi famously said
f0001_us_f0001_00339.wav	It no longer has our natural
f0001_us_f0001_00340.wav	People would come up to me after the conference
f0001_us_f0001_00341.wav	examined her cervical region
f0001_us_f0001_00342.wav	The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.
f0001_us_f0001_00343.wav	We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before
f0001_us_f0001_00344.wav	After treatment that's what it looks like.
f0001_us_f0001_00345.wav	You don't look disabled.
f0001_us_f0001_00346.wav	And so when Auenbrugger became a physician
f0001_us_f0001_00347.wav	was ruled upon by the U.S.
f0001_us_f0001_00348.wav	though it's often presented that way.
f0001_us_f0001_00349.wav	and we're just doing these little labors
f0001_us_f0001_00350.wav	it'd be really nice to contribute something to his memory.
f0001_us_f0001_00351.wav	And I've done this in three parts.
f0001_us_f0001_00352.wav	And what you can see is it's very non-uniform.
f0001_us_f0001_00353.wav	that if you've got energy
f0001_us_f0001_00354.wav	But in Hans Rosling's case
f0001_us_f0001_00355.wav	But if we think differently
f0001_us_f0001_00356.wav	and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound
f0001_us_f0001_00357.wav	They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.
f0001_us_f0001_00358.wav	So picture Bell sitting in the outpatient department
f0001_us_f0001_00359.wav	Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet
f0001_us_f0001_00360.wav	and the skies will open.
f0001_us_f0001_00361.wav	Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I've just been outlining
f0001_us_f0001_00362.wav	people are going directly to cell phones
f0001_us_f0001_00363.wav	And children in the first and second world
f0001_us_f0001_00364.wav	the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.
f0001_us_f0001_00365.wav	A lot of people thought  it was a publicity stunt for the movie.
f0001_us_f0001_00366.wav	Year after year after year
f0001_us_f0001_00367.wav	and then went to the couple in the booth next to us
f0001_us_f0001_00368.wav	And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
f0001_us_f0001_00369.wav	
f0001_us_f0001_00370.wav	
f0001_us_f0001_00371.wav	
f0001_us_f0001_00372.wav	People like Mahmoud are agents of change.
f0001_us_f0001_00373.wav	And how they're distributed really contributes to their underlying function.
f0001_us_f0001_00374.wav	you don't have to remember anything.
f0001_us_f0001_00375.wav	The good news is that this is happening today.
f0001_us_f0001_00376.wav	we don't hear those stories enough.
f0001_us_f0001_00377.wav	Why did we want to meet her
f0001_us_f0001_00378.wav	What's wrong with cafeterias
f0001_us_f0001_00379.wav	And they're catching up very dramatically.
f0001_us_f0001_00380.wav	So I spent time with evangelical Christians
f0001_us_f0001_00381.wav	if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy
f0001_us_f0001_00382.wav	These are refrigerators that require no electricity
f0001_us_f0001_00383.wav	and existing structures are falling apart.
f0001_us_f0001_00384.wav	and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.
f0001_us_f0001_00385.wav	We're using up about five planets.
f0001_us_f0001_00386.wav	But this is also very bizarre
f0001_us_f0001_00387.wav	Now I think that the potential is there
f0001_us_f0001_00388.wav	This phrase never sat right with me
f0001_us_f0001_00389.wav	This is a fabulous invention
f0001_us_f0001_00390.wav	and I found this lovely piece of reference.
f0001_us_f0001_00391.wav	I'm extremely grateful.
f0001_us_f0001_00392.wav	that's what she tells them.
f0001_us_f0001_00393.wav	the amount we're actually using.
f0001_us_f0001_00394.wav	I wanted to follow that rule.
f0001_us_f0001_00395.wav	I think that's absolutely right.
f0001_us_f0001_00396.wav	It's one of those things that stuck in my head.
f0001_us_f0001_00397.wav	The common disease or the rare disease
f0001_us_f0001_00398.wav	It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
f0001_us_f0001_00399.wav	it's an interesting thing
f0001_us_f0001_00400.wav	Now it's only at precise times when they align.
f0001_us_f0001_00401.wav	And then the laser actually cuts.
f0001_us_f0001_00402.wav	So we go out and play with it
f0001_us_f0001_00403.wav	And it's because of the experiences I've had with them
f0001_us_f0001_00404.wav	But some of our grandchildren probably will.
f0001_us_f0001_00405.wav	and I think we would do a good job in the future.
f0001_us_f0001_00406.wav	You can start to know where things are.
f0001_us_f0001_00407.wav	The first kind tells you
f0001_us_f0001_00408.wav	I would listen to the heart.
f0001_us_f0001_00409.wav	It's a fabulous place.
f0001_us_f0001_00410.wav	absolutely incredible.
f0001_us_f0001_00411.wav	And so what you're looking at here in donor one and donor four
f0001_us_f0001_00412.wav	you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
f0001_us_f0001_00413.wav	They are multinational
f0001_us_f0001_00414.wav	Changing that pattern requires a scope
f0001_us_f0001_00415.wav	and he's kind and loving now.
f0001_us_f0001_00416.wav	the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich.
f0001_us_f0001_00417.wav	and are going to increase growth more than ever before.
f0001_us_f0001_00418.wav	the last IPCC summary
f0001_us_f0001_00419.wav	And that makes failure seem much more crushing.
f0001_us_f0001_00420.wav	this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
f0001_us_f0001_00421.wav	so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.
f0001_us_f0001_00422.wav	a thousand years from now
f0001_us_f0001_00423.wav	having completed this
f0001_us_f0001_00424.wav	but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.
f0001_us_f0001_00425.wav	When are they going to come by and explain things to me
f0001_us_f0001_00426.wav	You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends
f0001_us_f0001_00427.wav	if you live in a moist
f0001_us_f0001_00428.wav	Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work.
f0001_us_f0001_00429.wav	Let's take meritocracy.
f0001_us_f0001_00430.wav	If you are investing in tar sands  or shale oil
f0001_us_f0001_00431.wav	To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately
f0001_us_f0001_00432.wav	And that was democracy growing up
f0001_us_f0001_00433.wav	will re-grow that limb.
f0001_us_f0001_00434.wav	It's a conversation about potential.
f0001_us_f0001_00435.wav	it's just slightly larger than the two fists.
f0001_us_f0001_00436.wav	You get grassroots solutions
f0001_us_f0001_00437.wav	We don't have time to go into all of those details
f0001_us_f0001_00438.wav	hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback.
f0001_us_f0001_00439.wav	but it still leaves something behind.
f0001_us_f0001_00440.wav	we can keep on doing it for a very long time.
f0001_us_f0001_00441.wav	since we can now start to map brain function
f0001_us_f0001_00442.wav	and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.
f0002_us_f0002_00001.wav	This is the same procedure
f0002_us_f0002_00002.wav	but one of the things that he's doing is
f0002_us_f0002_00003.wav	So the incentives are much larger to produce drugs which treat more people.
f0002_us_f0002_00004.wav	then we see the differences
f0002_us_f0002_00005.wav	Holy shit! They're the same! No matter what the shapes were
f0002_us_f0002_00006.wav	that chunk of metal can be in two different places
f0002_us_f0002_00007.wav	So I made a deal with the adults  that the kids could come in
f0002_us_f0002_00008.wav	the sperm is carrying an X chromosome
f0002_us_f0002_00009.wav	in higher soul-like concerns
f0002_us_f0002_00010.wav	So we light our buildings with daylight.
f0002_us_f0002_00011.wav	And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did of saying
f0002_us_f0002_00012.wav	So we should do everything we can
f0002_us_f0002_00013.wav	And that's affecting their academic achievement.
f0002_us_f0002_00014.wav	We've done right now two human brains-worth of data.
f0002_us_f0002_00015.wav	in a situated fashion
f0002_us_f0002_00016.wav	Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.
f0002_us_f0002_00017.wav	The treaties were out the window.
f0002_us_f0002_00018.wav	the simplicity gets complex.
f0002_us_f0002_00019.wav	I'm going to increase the speed by two each time
f0002_us_f0002_00020.wav	a lot of them were very interested in science
f0002_us_f0002_00021.wav	you're kind of alienating a large client there.
f0002_us_f0002_00022.wav	When I run it through my lab
f0002_us_f0002_00023.wav	at least eight billion people.
f0002_us_f0002_00024.wav	his stick fingers made their way up to his pajama shirt
f0002_us_f0002_00025.wav	Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief
f0002_us_f0002_00026.wav	something else that is being worshiped.
f0002_us_f0002_00027.wav	we ended the time of treaty-making.
f0002_us_f0002_00028.wav	I locked myself in a room
f0002_us_f0002_00029.wav	It's good for everybody.
f0002_us_f0002_00030.wav	Now what's the problem with this
f0002_us_f0002_00031.wav	I sat a moment and I heard Rafi telling his father
f0002_us_f0002_00032.wav	we can lay out the frames side by side
f0002_us_f0002_00033.wav	you would look just like Al Gore.
f0002_us_f0002_00034.wav	spilling out of the body here.
f0002_us_f0002_00035.wav	But you can also see things underneath there as well.
f0002_us_f0002_00036.wav	who'd done some work with the U.S.
f0002_us_f0002_00037.wav	Most people make a strict correlation between how much time
f0002_us_f0002_00038.wav	which is nice work if you can get it.
f0002_us_f0002_00039.wav	the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything.
f0002_us_f0002_00040.wav	How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places
f0002_us_f0002_00041.wav	I just noticed that as I finished this skull,
f0002_us_f0002_00042.wav	and we started looking for a place to eat.
f0002_us_f0002_00043.wav	This is not in your head.
f0002_us_f0002_00044.wav	There were so many things new to me.
f0002_us_f0002_00045.wav	So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time
f0002_us_f0002_00046.wav	if they're surrounded by places that make them feel at home
f0002_us_f0002_00047.wav	The universe is large and we are tiny
f0002_us_f0002_00048.wav	the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track
f0002_us_f0002_00049.wav	And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these .
f0002_us_f0002_00050.wav	Investments in education are increasing the supply of  new ideas.
f0002_us_f0002_00051.wav	we can't learn to see until we admit we're blind.
f0002_us_f0002_00053.wav	what are we looking for
f0002_us_f0002_00054.wav	Thank you for that reaction.
f0002_us_f0002_00055.wav	and we're responding to androgens.
f0002_us_f0002_00056.wav	The man was without legs and only with one arm.
f0002_us_f0002_00057.wav	And as Dan Buettner can tell you
f0002_us_f0002_00058.wav	This a place where the dead are brought in.
f0002_us_f0002_00059.wav	This is a different kind of boy and a different kind of girl.
f0002_us_f0002_00060.wav	the exemplary father figures in society
f0002_us_f0002_00061.wav	Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma.
f0002_us_f0002_00062.wav	So if you take a deeper look at the brain
f0002_us_f0002_00063.wav	he had to be the bearer
f0002_us_f0002_00064.wav	Sometimes I see a lot of it
f0002_us_f0002_00065.wav	I'm just going to try slip in it.
f0002_us_f0002_00066.wav	for these particular patients
f0002_us_f0002_00067.wav	He's just a little boy.
f0002_us_f0002_00068.wav	and it's another thing to see that system as it ebbs and flows.
f0002_us_f0002_00069.wav	But it's a big part of the Bible
f0002_us_f0002_00070.wav	So what I want to argue for
f0002_us_f0002_00071.wav	but I want to show you two short clips.
f0002_us_f0002_00072.wav	the exact meaning of the word educate comes from the root word educe.
f0002_us_f0002_00073.wav	and maybe even understand.
f0002_us_f0002_00074.wav	Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception
f0002_us_f0002_00075.wav	There's the cerebellum
f0002_us_f0002_00076.wav	And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you.
f0002_us_f0002_00077.wav	Britney has loomed pretty large lately.
f0002_us_f0002_00078.wav	I'm a journalist and not a technologist
f0002_us_f0002_00079.wav	government openly declared its position on Native rights.
f0002_us_f0002_00080.wav	It's a very logical plan
f0002_us_f0002_00081.wav	And people are embracing this.
f0002_us_f0002_00082.wav	how we live best in dense environments.
f0002_us_f0002_00083.wav	The discussion is all about images on the computer
f0002_us_f0002_00084.wav	basically we have public leaders
f0002_us_f0002_00085.wav	And then she was nervous.
f0002_us_f0002_00086.wav	cannot in all the states have the same right that Henry has in all the states
f0002_us_f0002_00087.wav	or a mosque or a cathedral
f0002_us_f0002_00088.wav	exhibit irresponsible behavior
f0002_us_f0002_00089.wav	And it contracts in summer.
f0002_us_f0002_00090.wav	If you're in the art world
f0002_us_f0002_00091.wav	It's called Drop Dead Healthy.
f0002_us_f0002_00092.wav	like I did with the dodo skull
f0002_us_f0002_00093.wav	And I met a music video director named Chris Milk.
f0002_us_f0002_00094.wav	How many Ramanujans are there in India today toiling in the fields
f0002_us_f0002_00095.wav	minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
f0002_us_f0002_00096.wav	We would like to start it
f0002_us_f0002_00097.wav	is not that we should give up on our ideas of success.
f0002_us_f0002_00098.wav	two workers per retiree in the U.S.
f0002_us_f0002_00099.wav	What we fear is the judgement and ridicule of others.
f0002_us_f0002_00100.wav	we need to increase the production of feet.
f0002_us_f0002_00101.wav	We talk about how another world isn't just possible
f0002_us_f0002_00102.wav	is to have an African anatomy in terms of your history.
f0002_us_f0002_00103.wav	Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.
f0002_us_f0002_00104.wav	Somebody that might even be super-abled.
f0002_us_f0002_00105.wav	we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool
f0002_us_f0002_00106.wav	the American Indian Movement
f0002_us_f0002_00107.wav	There are hair follicles on them
f0002_us_f0002_00108.wav	And I spoke with a gatekeeper.
f0002_us_f0002_00109.wav	We'll come back to these people later.
f0002_us_f0002_00110.wav	Growth of six percent a year.
f0002_us_f0002_00111.wav	because this photo completely rocked my world.
f0002_us_f0002_00112.wav	I was very influenced by that anecdote.
f0002_us_f0002_00113.wav	It's a remarkable thing.
f0002_us_f0002_00114.wav	but it showed bilateral
f0002_us_f0002_00115.wav	which helps it bubble up to the top.
f0002_us_f0002_00116.wav	his voice behind me say
f0002_us_f0002_00117.wav	And they're quite subtle.
f0002_us_f0002_00118.wav	more powerful than ever before
f0002_us_f0002_00119.wav	towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
f0002_us_f0002_00120.wav	They see us as adults
f0002_us_f0002_00121.wav	their names still vivid on my tongue
f0002_us_f0002_00122.wav	Perhaps this is just me
f0002_us_f0002_00123.wav	so she sat in every seat in our apartment
f0002_us_f0002_00124.wav	he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.
f0002_us_f0002_00125.wav	Here is just a little bit of data.
f0002_us_f0002_00126.wav	particularly in the United States
f0002_us_f0002_00127.wav	which is just as good as my link.
f0002_us_f0002_00128.wav	but preparing them to meet it well.
f0002_us_f0002_00129.wav	the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
f0002_us_f0002_00130.wav	But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.
f0002_us_f0002_00131.wav	These are now two years out.
f0002_us_f0002_00132.wav	And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
f0002_us_f0002_00133.wav	you see on the West coast planes moving across
f0002_us_f0002_00134.wav	as important as it is to change the light bulbs
f0002_us_f0002_00135.wav	You must become the change you wish to see in the world.
f0002_us_f0002_00136.wav	Our lives are being driven by data
f0002_us_f0002_00137.wav	And we have to organize our response  appropriately.
f0002_us_f0002_00138.wav	Well I don't know yet
f0002_us_f0002_00139.wav	You may not agree with the ideas
f0002_us_f0002_00140.wav	You're just picking and choosing.
f0002_us_f0002_00141.wav	A third of the people on this planet are kids.
f0002_us_f0002_00142.wav	or a diary that lives in a box somewhere.
f0002_us_f0002_00143.wav	would change the game.
f0002_us_f0002_00144.wav	So when the children see this
f0002_us_f0002_00145.wav	I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything
f0002_us_f0002_00146.wav	Those who were still around in school
f0002_us_f0002_00147.wav	we would get a lot more out of art.
f0002_us_f0002_00148.wav	And they don't really change much.
f0002_us_f0002_00149.wav	we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.
f0002_us_f0002_00150.wav	in terms of the identity
f0002_us_f0002_00151.wav	they believe that we are in severe need of assistance.
f0002_us_f0002_00152.wav	You can be logical and intuitive.
f0002_us_f0002_00153.wav	She speaks in a funny way.
f0002_us_f0002_00154.wav	plain English consumer credit agreement.
f0002_us_f0002_00155.wav	I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.
f0002_us_f0002_00156.wav	you better be able to write your name legibly
f0002_us_f0002_00157.wav	This is what I wanted to say.
f0002_us_f0002_00158.wav	we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment
f0002_us_f0002_00159.wav	Why did you come back and get your care here
f0002_us_f0002_00160.wav	Mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs.
f0002_us_f0002_00161.wav	trying to forecast future growth for the United States
f0002_us_f0002_00162.wav	But in this century China is coming on line.
f0002_us_f0002_00163.wav	Tribes lost millions of acres.
f0002_us_f0002_00164.wav	Here's what he wrote in starting that out.
f0002_us_f0002_00165.wav	So you put that up front so that
f0002_us_f0002_00166.wav	his mind was locked inside his body.
f0002_us_f0002_00167.wav	The United States has been an idea leader.
f0002_us_f0002_00168.wav	if it's more coming in.
f0002_us_f0002_00169.wav	it's tricky to see what's going on.
f0002_us_f0002_00170.wav	and the second one took three more
f0002_us_f0002_00171.wav	real car near the end of the video.
f0002_us_f0002_00172.wav	So I'm going to end it there.
f0002_us_f0002_00173.wav	whether or not there is a God
f0002_us_f0002_00174.wav	The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.
f0002_us_f0002_00175.wav	some of you might well know that the barber pole
f0002_us_f0002_00176.wav	then I slide my hand up to the epitrochlear node
f0002_us_f0002_00177.wav	about our status in the world today
f0002_us_f0002_00178.wav	and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
f0002_us_f0002_00179.wav	This drying around the world has lead to  a dramatic increase in fires.
f0002_us_f0002_00180.wav	They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.
f0002_us_f0002_00181.wav	And we can mobilize resources and political will.
f0002_us_f0002_00182.wav	I'd like to tell you about one such child
f0002_us_f0002_00183.wav	It's not about a scientific rendering of a sheep.
f0002_us_f0002_00184.wav	Let's look at neurons.
f0002_us_f0002_00185.wav	So they introduced me to five families.
f0002_us_f0002_00186.wav	the fat of the land goes to wasichu.
f0002_us_f0002_00187.wav	then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
f0002_us_f0002_00188.wav	Mahmoud had looked taller.
f0002_us_f0002_00189.wav	And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque
f0002_us_f0002_00190.wav	combined with deep inequalities.
f0002_us_f0002_00191.wav	They started a public campaign that says
f0002_us_f0002_00192.wav	I never miss a single training session.
f0002_us_f0002_00193.wav	And so our project is seeking to look at this readout
f0002_us_f0002_00194.wav	but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.
f0002_us_f0002_00195.wav	Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color
f0002_us_f0002_00196.wav	It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.
f0002_us_f0002_00197.wav	Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.
f0002_us_f0002_00198.wav	And a woman comes in with a child
f0002_us_f0002_00199.wav	no one will believe you till they get a CAT scan
f0002_us_f0002_00200.wav	but they want their own version of a life which is more prosperous
f0002_us_f0002_00201.wav	They understand where to make these assignments.
f0002_us_f0002_00202.wav	So I'm not going to do that
f0002_us_f0002_00203.wav	with my view of simplicity
f0002_us_f0002_00204.wav	so our project is seeking to look at this readout
f0002_us_f0002_00205.wav	You can see on the microscope slide here
f0002_us_f0002_00206.wav	But I do believe that between now and November
f0002_us_f0002_00207.wav	the physical rehabilitation was suspended.
f0002_us_f0002_00208.wav	are not going to change anything.
f0002_us_f0002_00209.wav	and it'll cool it down to just above freezing
f0002_us_f0002_00210.wav	The so-called permanent ice
f0002_us_f0002_00211.wav	in the process of identification
f0002_us_f0002_00212.wav	And everybody disappeared from the street.
f0002_us_f0002_00213.wav	the humanity behind this hugely mechanical process.
f0002_us_f0002_00214.wav	we would truly be able to do something different.
f0002_us_f0002_00215.wav	And so the following day
f0002_us_f0002_00216.wav	It's the coolest stuff.
f0002_us_f0002_00217.wav	a lot of different sheep.
f0002_us_f0002_00218.wav	So again this is what they can see under the microscope.
f0002_us_f0002_00219.wav	And I think that's what the religious wars of late have ignored.
f0002_us_f0002_00220.wav	physical rehabilitation is a priority.
f0002_us_f0002_00221.wav	that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy.
f0002_us_f0002_00222.wav	there was a clear lesson here.
f0002_us_f0002_00223.wav	that this way of working
f0002_us_f0002_00224.wav	The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari don't think
f0002_us_f0002_00225.wav	my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation
f0002_us_f0002_00226.wav	This is from a game called Food Force
f0002_us_f0002_00227.wav	that the food stocks would become depleted
f0002_us_f0002_00228.wav	My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions.
f0002_us_f0002_00229.wav	along with a number of colleagues around the world.
f0002_us_f0002_00230.wav	undiscovered continent.
f0002_us_f0002_00231.wav	Just to give him some money.
f0002_us_f0002_00232.wav	maybe even dancing with it.
f0002_us_f0002_00233.wav	where nobody has any idea what it is they're working on.
f0002_us_f0002_00234.wav	will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
f0002_us_f0002_00235.wav	I grew up with the scientific worldview
f0002_us_f0002_00236.wav	you lose a little bit of volume
f0002_us_f0002_00237.wav	And it was fascinating
f0002_us_f0002_00238.wav	So don't worry about climate change.
f0002_us_f0002_00239.wav	When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world
f0002_us_f0002_00240.wav	is to take a look at TED.
f0002_us_f0002_00241.wav	Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something.
f0002_us_f0002_00242.wav	the novels of Jane Austen.
f0002_us_f0002_00243.wav	And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming
f0002_us_f0002_00244.wav	looking like she had a strong grip.
f0002_us_f0002_00245.wav	along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists
f0002_us_f0002_00246.wav	How could I be more successful
f0002_us_f0002_00247.wav	This is practically the model of TED.
f0002_us_f0002_00248.wav	when writing about evolution
f0002_us_f0002_00249.wav	It was really a fascinating journey.
f0002_us_f0002_00250.wav	that's where we put a lot of money.
f0002_us_f0002_00251.wav	to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients.
f0002_us_f0002_00252.wav	This is an older lady.
f0002_us_f0002_00253.wav	then you would  expect it to be warmer here and cooler here.
f0002_us_f0002_00254.wav	religions are so subtle
f0002_us_f0002_00255.wav	Once you do those things
f0002_us_f0002_00256.wav	and the total was nine on that one
f0002_us_f0002_00257.wav	You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator
f0002_us_f0002_00258.wav	So we were excited by this idea
f0002_us_f0002_00259.wav	These humpback whales were getting killed.
f0002_us_f0002_00260.wav	but that it's ridiculous.
f0002_us_f0002_00261.wav	buy green electricity where you can.
f0002_us_f0002_00262.wav	We were seeking normal human brains.
f0002_us_f0002_00263.wav	And the whole idea of one's relationship to their work changed  a lot.
f0002_us_f0002_00264.wav	building humanity into communications.
f0002_us_f0002_00265.wav	I always begin with the pulse
f0002_us_f0002_00266.wav	How many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities
f0002_us_f0002_00267.wav	Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender
f0002_us_f0002_00268.wav	This is spreading everywhere.
f0002_us_f0002_00269.wav	My favorite example is a drill.
f0002_us_f0002_00270.wav	And as we get farther and farther with our science
f0002_us_f0002_00271.wav	like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast
f0002_us_f0002_00272.wav	They give researchers a handle on where to go.
f0002_us_f0002_00273.wav	And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.
f0002_us_f0002_00274.wav	I spray it on for about three or four days
f0002_us_f0002_00275.wav	If I start the little game here that the kids have done
f0002_us_f0002_00276.wav	It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
f0002_us_f0002_00277.wav	It's an impossible dream.
f0002_us_f0002_00278.wav	particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.
f0002_us_f0002_00279.wav	And it's not just in terms of sex.
f0002_us_f0002_00280.wav	And then the surprise turns into hope.
f0002_us_f0002_00281.wav	accidents of things dropping on people's heads
f0002_us_f0002_00282.wav	What is going to be the next change
f0002_us_f0002_00283.wav	Now we're already starting to see some experiments here.
f0002_us_f0002_00284.wav	Should we send this child to the psychologist
f0002_us_f0002_00285.wav	when I do a talk like this
f0002_us_f0002_00286.wav	I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back.
f0002_us_f0002_00287.wav	You have taught me to walk.
f0002_us_f0002_00288.wav	And I believe this is going to prove true.
f0002_us_f0002_00289.wav	he'll check all the boxes
f0002_us_f0002_00290.wav	This is hitting the reservoirs.
f0002_us_f0002_00291.wav	you lose a little bit of size.
f0002_us_f0002_00292.wav	which is a pretty great thing.
f0002_us_f0002_00293.wav	You can see that blue dot there cutting.
f0002_us_f0002_00294.wav	Now I think that's a very beautiful idea and a very true idea.
f0002_us_f0002_00295.wav	Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it
f0002_us_f0002_00296.wav	I met with creationists.
f0002_us_f0002_00297.wav	and he made this amazing Flash drawing tool.
f0002_us_f0002_00298.wav	If there are landlines in many developing world cities
f0002_us_f0002_00299.wav	and I've become very close with them
f0002_us_f0002_00300.wav	I find the last two words under Near Antonyms particularly unsettling
f0002_us_f0002_00301.wav	they won't be able to do that anymore.
f0002_us_f0002_00302.wav	We went off a cliff but we recovered.
f0002_us_f0002_00303.wav	and we put them on a website called TenThousandsCents.
f0002_us_f0002_00304.wav	the alternative is unimaginable.
f0002_us_f0002_00305.wav	I'm a physician practicing with cutting-edge technology.
f0002_us_f0002_00306.wav	which was when this meme started
f0002_us_f0002_00307.wav	The thread that links them all
f0002_us_f0002_00308.wav	intervene at a much earlier stage than when we saw her.
f0002_us_f0002_00309.wav	a tabloid newspaper that I don't recommend you to start reading
f0002_us_f0002_00310.wav	most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere
f0002_us_f0002_00311.wav	and I was going to improve U.S.
f0002_us_f0002_00312.wav	I don't want them to be teased at school by the other students.
f0002_us_f0002_00313.wav	They've bounded the city with a line.
f0002_us_f0002_00314.wav	the number of elementary school classroom teachers has been cut in half.
f0002_us_f0002_00315.wav	It's three times hotter than Mercury
f0002_us_f0002_00316.wav	So I was able to actually  screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure.
f0002_us_f0002_00317.wav	to claim their own descriptions of themselves
f0002_us_f0002_00318.wav	I go to schools to talk to young
f0002_us_f0002_00319.wav	and it's people who trade
f0002_us_f0002_00320.wav	Put a price on carbon.
f0002_us_f0002_00321.wav	They tell us to have a bath.
f0002_us_f0002_00322.wav	and Long Beach on the bottom.
f0002_us_f0002_00323.wav	their roots will detect the chemicals in them
f0002_us_f0002_00324.wav	and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box
f0002_us_f0002_00325.wav	they're multinational
f0002_us_f0002_00326.wav	the patient said to me with some awe
f0002_us_f0002_00327.wav	finishing up with triple-zero steel wool.
f0002_us_f0002_00328.wav	you politely ignore it.
f0002_us_f0002_00329.wav	it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish.
f0002_us_f0002_00330.wav	Tell people what it means.
f0002_us_f0002_00331.wav	When a spirit has those qualities
f0002_us_f0002_00332.wav	And you can pause it and step back and forth and see different phases.
f0002_us_f0002_00333.wav	And that problem is envy.
f0002_us_f0002_00334.wav	There's so much we can absorb.
f0002_us_f0002_00335.wav	that all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.
f0002_us_f0002_00336.wav	They're in the back of our body.
f0002_us_f0002_00337.wav	and that concept was all men are created equal.
f0002_us_f0002_00338.wav	the first to be selectively bred for production traits
f0002_us_f0002_00339.wav	When the child is born
f0002_us_f0002_00340.wav	And I'm teaching myself to knit
f0002_us_f0002_00341.wav	Let's look to the plays of Shakespeare
f0002_us_f0002_00342.wav	and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book.
f0002_us_f0002_00343.wav	I want to share briefly a Tale of Two Planets.
f0002_us_f0002_00344.wav	which is one of the greenest buildings in the world.
f0002_us_f0002_00345.wav	so this is about a baby hair's width.
f0002_us_f0002_00346.wav	And so I consider myself one of these people
f0002_us_f0002_00347.wav	without lessening mine.
f0002_us_f0002_00348.wav	And that's why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans
f0002_us_f0002_00349.wav	what if you really did take the Bible literally
f0002_us_f0002_00350.wav	All of those conversations need to be happening.
f0002_us_f0002_00351.wav	as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece
f0002_us_f0002_00352.wav	and is at the heart of the patient-physician relationship.
f0002_us_f0002_00353.wav	To put this differently
f0002_us_f0002_00354.wav	this is where we're projected to go with the U.S.
f0002_us_f0002_00355.wav	Now I have to write what she tells me to write.
f0002_us_f0002_00356.wav	in the United States today
f0002_us_f0002_00357.wav	You see the cells coming back out.
f0002_us_f0002_00358.wav	I like to think that I do a thorough physical exam
f0002_us_f0002_00359.wav	and when the patient came for the physical
f0002_us_f0002_00360.wav	there may even be a simpler approach.
f0002_us_f0002_00361.wav	Let me just tell you two really quickly.
f0002_us_f0002_00362.wav	And it's that that that I'm trying to leave room for.
f0002_us_f0002_00363.wav	so I can't go on a pilgrimage.
f0002_us_f0002_00364.wav	And there's been a shift in my thinking over time
f0002_us_f0002_00365.wav	you can think of this as almost mapping our interstate highways
f0002_us_f0002_00366.wav	This is somebody who is greedy.
f0002_us_f0002_00367.wav	This is a diabetic ulcer.
f0002_us_f0002_00368.wav	and then the right half
f0002_us_f0002_00369.wav	but delivered something individually unique to each person who contributed
f0002_us_f0002_00370.wav	Latest studies from NASA.
f0002_us_f0002_00371.wav	and Conan Doyle describes the following exchange.
f0002_us_f0002_00372.wav	is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton.
f0002_us_f0002_00373.wav	I've also been interested in sex difference research.
f0002_us_f0002_00374.wav	attention deficit disorder
f0002_us_f0002_00375.wav	So as the song picks up emotion
f0002_us_f0002_00376.wav	So I had always thought
f0002_us_f0002_00377.wav	so that wasn't happening.
f0002_us_f0002_00378.wav	But the religious world doesn't think that way.
f0002_us_f0002_00379.wav	And that's a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers.
f0002_us_f0002_00380.wav	And then we find some outliers
f0002_us_f0002_00381.wav	in the Fifth Century B.
f0002_us_f0002_00382.wav	they're pot within a pot design.
f0002_us_f0002_00383.wav	The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment
f0002_us_f0002_00384.wav	So here's a few statistics from the project.
f0002_us_f0002_00385.wav	He was a college professor at a state school
f0002_us_f0002_00386.wav	it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.
f0002_us_f0002_00387.wav	and beetroots out the top
f0002_us_f0002_00388.wav	I'll pay you two cents for your contribution.
f0002_us_f0002_00389.wav	I'm exercising every day
f0002_us_f0002_00390.wav	That gives you an idea of the different types of motivations and dedication.
f0002_us_f0002_00391.wav	instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus
f0002_us_f0002_00392.wav	if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body
f0002_us_f0002_00393.wav	and I can paint my toenails.
f0002_us_f0002_00394.wav	They don't just deliver us sermons on this.
f0002_us_f0002_00395.wav	And one of the things we're really
f0002_us_f0002_00396.wav	It was so overwhelming
f0002_us_f0002_00397.wav	And so she must have taken the ferry over.
f0002_us_f0002_00398.wav	don't do this in the school handbook
f0002_us_f0002_00399.wav	We don't have a situation that Iran has
f0002_us_f0002_00400.wav	So what we have is a sort of situation where the farther our science goes
f0002_us_f0002_00401.wav	so we seem to have drifted away.
f0003_us_f0003_00001.wav	This started an incredible journey.
f0003_us_f0003_00002.wav	This started an incredible journey.
f0003_us_f0003_00003.wav	And we shouldn't behave as though it is known.
f0003_us_f0003_00004.wav	marching with the Girl Scouts
f0003_us_f0003_00005.wav	And if you find one that you're interested in
f0003_us_f0003_00006.wav	And this little girl comes up to me.
f0003_us_f0003_00007.wav	or that I'm so different from
f0003_us_f0003_00008.wav	everything you've posted onto Twitter
f0003_us_f0003_00009.wav	We're also selecting for brains in which we can get the tissue
f0003_us_f0003_00010.wav	But this wasn't really out of altruism.
f0003_us_f0003_00011.wav	I think this is really cool.
f0003_us_f0003_00012.wav	The Japanese government were perhaps the first
f0003_us_f0003_00013.wav	and try to live by the Bible.
f0003_us_f0003_00014.wav	and try to live the Bible.
f0003_us_f0003_00015.wav	he offers us something of a solution in his I have a dream speech.
f0003_us_f0003_00016.wav	all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power
f0003_us_f0003_00017.wav	and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that
f0003_us_f0003_00018.wav	perhaps even before it was symptomatic
f0003_us_f0003_00019.wav	So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion
f0003_us_f0003_00020.wav	so on the one hand we have the unthinkable
f0003_us_f0003_00021.wav	So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union
f0003_us_f0003_00022.wav	Just in the last two days
f0003_us_f0003_00023.wav	or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear
f0003_us_f0003_00024.wav	or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear
f0003_us_f0003_00025.wav	We went from bed to bed.
f0003_us_f0003_00026.wav	And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.
f0003_us_f0003_00027.wav	Sub-Saharan Africa has been the area of the world most resistant to growth.
f0003_us_f0003_00028.wav	This is the place where we make the legs.
f0003_us_f0003_00029.wav	I still have to ask you the question
f0003_us_f0003_00030.wav	And maybe that's where we need to go in the future
f0003_us_f0003_00031.wav	So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal
f0003_us_f0003_00032.wav	But here's what really perplexed me.
f0003_us_f0003_00033.wav	I'm pistoning out of it.
f0003_us_f0003_00034.wav	even I could tell my hip was bad.
f0003_us_f0003_00035.wav	we are able to create new realities and new ways of being.
f0003_us_f0003_00036.wav	it's hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization.
f0003_us_f0003_00037.wav	they may do the healing.
f0003_us_f0003_00038.wav	And there's a lot of reasons why I chose sheep.
f0003_us_f0003_00039.wav	There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious
f0003_us_f0003_00040.wav	And I think this is what we've done with climate change.
f0003_us_f0003_00041.wav	Here go the stem cells
f0003_us_f0003_00042.wav	We find men on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement saying
f0003_us_f0003_00043.wav	and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active
f0003_us_f0003_00044.wav	and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active
f0003_us_f0003_00045.wav	the tools we use to change the world
f0003_us_f0003_00046.wav	and it's particularly bad for boys.
f0003_us_f0003_00047.wav	That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time
f0003_us_f0003_00048.wav	That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time
f0003_us_f0003_00049.wav	and I got a good look at them
f0003_us_f0003_00050.wav	The brain is removed from the skull
f0003_us_f0003_00051.wav	This is from A Force More Powerful.
f0003_us_f0003_00052.wav	was inspired by Sir Joseph Bell.
f0003_us_f0003_00053.wav	And you can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.
f0003_us_f0003_00054.wav	Art is about two things in all the major faiths.
f0003_us_f0003_00055.wav	it's full of people who've messed up their lives.
f0003_us_f0003_00056.wav	and then we develop our intuition from there.
f0003_us_f0003_00057.wav	And it was successful overall.
f0003_us_f0003_00058.wav	If a guy from Mars came down and saw
f0003_us_f0003_00059.wav	But there are also  regional environmental problems
f0003_us_f0003_00060.wav	But it was a terrific job.
f0003_us_f0003_00061.wav	which is a significant shift.
f0003_us_f0003_00062.wav	a child will achieve.
f0003_us_f0003_00063.wav	right at their center
f0003_us_f0003_00064.wav	It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
f0003_us_f0003_00065.wav	I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.
f0003_us_f0003_00066.wav	if you look through her records
f0003_us_f0003_00067.wav	The first is zero tolerance.
f0003_us_f0003_00068.wav	as we're weeping softly into our pillows.
f0003_us_f0003_00069.wav	a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
f0003_us_f0003_00070.wav	But the difference is
f0003_us_f0003_00071.wav	ths isn't exactly true.
f0003_us_f0003_00072.wav	Which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion.
f0003_us_f0003_00073.wav	When we analyzed all the news stories and removed just one story
f0003_us_f0003_00074.wav	based on the short-term returns
f0003_us_f0003_00075.wav	and it told me to go via Guernsey.
f0003_us_f0003_00076.wav	At that time I found myself in a strange situation.
f0003_us_f0003_00077.wav	that salaries are still significantly lower
f0003_us_f0003_00078.wav	People were actually getting poorer than their parents.
f0003_us_f0003_00079.wav	ought to be beautiful in themselves.
f0003_us_f0003_00080.wav	We've slightly lost the habit of doing that.
f0003_us_f0003_00081.wav	So the kids want to do a steering wheel.
f0003_us_f0003_00082.wav	And it is based on an old model.
f0003_us_f0003_00083.wav	like it is in the movie.
f0003_us_f0003_00084.wav	and where are they going to find sources of consolation
f0003_us_f0003_00085.wav	We are highly open to suggestion.
f0003_us_f0003_00086.wav	And the IRS has introduced the program.
f0003_us_f0003_00087.wav	because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
f0003_us_f0003_00088.wav	We need to put ourselves into boy culture.
f0003_us_f0003_00089.wav	the one with the white coat.
f0003_us_f0003_00090.wav	The way I like to put this is
f0003_us_f0003_00091.wav	I've sketched a sort of broad framework.
f0003_us_f0003_00092.wav	they come from all walks of life.
f0003_us_f0003_00093.wav	The bad news is that's not true.
f0003_us_f0003_00094.wav	And in our modern country
f0003_us_f0003_00095.wav	It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.
f0003_us_f0003_00096.wav	if we see adversity as natural
f0003_us_f0003_00097.wav	That's the annual ice in winter.
f0003_us_f0003_00098.wav	So if you want understand the action of drugs
f0003_us_f0003_00099.wav	I think it would be very unusual for anyone here
f0003_us_f0003_00100.wav	I went to the orthopedic center.
f0003_us_f0003_00101.wav	I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted.
f0003_us_f0003_00102.wav	They wanted it to end precisely on time.
f0003_us_f0003_00103.wav	the message is we will treat your symptoms
f0003_us_f0003_00104.wav	in communities all across the country
f0003_us_f0003_00105.wav	They're collaborative
f0003_us_f0003_00106.wav	there is twice as much light available for everyone.
f0003_us_f0003_00107.wav	And what I need now is to learn to be like that.
f0003_us_f0003_00108.wav	I was going everyday to work for the homeless.
f0003_us_f0003_00109.wav	and find out at the end of a journey
f0003_us_f0003_00110.wav	It had a beautiful facility
f0003_us_f0003_00111.wav	I did pray the other day
f0003_us_f0003_00112.wav	So get on your knees and repeat it.
f0003_us_f0003_00113.wav	they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen.
f0003_us_f0003_00114.wav	the terms of the second Fort Laramie Treaty had been violated.
f0003_us_f0003_00115.wav	There were many other things to do.
f0003_us_f0003_00116.wav	But I will ask the question
f0003_us_f0003_00117.wav	but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society
f0003_us_f0003_00118.wav	TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.
f0003_us_f0003_00119.wav	You get new tools for people in the developing world.
f0003_us_f0003_00120.wav	As I mentioned last year
f0003_us_f0003_00121.wav	was a man called John Wesley
f0003_us_f0003_00122.wav	Is China drinking our milkshake
f0003_us_f0003_00123.wav	they created an entire marketing campaign around it.
f0003_us_f0003_00124.wav	and I passed it through until
f0003_us_f0003_00125.wav	most boys tend to be a certain way
f0003_us_f0003_00126.wav	and we're eating all sorts of stuff.
f0003_us_f0003_00127.wav	After previewing it and confirming it's what you submitted
f0003_us_f0003_00128.wav	real car works every time
f0003_us_f0003_00129.wav	and integrating it into teaching resident students
f0003_us_f0003_00130.wav	can cause real damage
f0003_us_f0003_00131.wav	But what this does to our children is really not healthy.
f0003_us_f0003_00132.wav	and over time cost less.
f0003_us_f0003_00133.wav	we gotta get you on the table.
f0003_us_f0003_00134.wav	And the story is that Leopold Auenbrugger was the son of an innkeeper.
f0003_us_f0003_00135.wav	This story eclipsed every country except Iraq
f0003_us_f0003_00136.wav	the red and white stripes
f0003_us_f0003_00137.wav	if you're trying to get a small business loan
f0003_us_f0003_00138.wav	We want our babies to read when they are six months old.
f0003_us_f0003_00139.wav	you're going to get short-term decisions.
f0003_us_f0003_00140.wav	but we also open sourced it
f0003_us_f0003_00141.wav	You'd be fed a simple audio clip.
f0003_us_f0003_00142.wav	And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things.
f0003_us_f0003_00143.wav	many ancient societies
f0003_us_f0003_00144.wav	we decide that we're going to prevent dementia
f0003_us_f0003_00145.wav	The night before a match I'm very nervous.
f0003_us_f0003_00146.wav	And if you look really carefully
f0003_us_f0003_00147.wav	just taking photographs.
f0003_us_f0003_00148.wav	Because sometimes people from outside the U.S.
f0003_us_f0003_00149.wav	It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum
f0003_us_f0003_00150.wav	So why don't we hear more about the world
f0003_us_f0003_00151.wav	like dirty coal and foreign oil.
f0003_us_f0003_00152.wav	they'll actually list these specimens
f0003_us_f0003_00153.wav	that's what's happening in real time.
f0003_us_f0003_00154.wav	posted with tools and limited-use copyrights
f0003_us_f0003_00155.wav	And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands
f0003_us_f0003_00156.wav	and you will become more compassionate.
f0003_us_f0003_00157.wav	and he gave them  one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon.
f0003_us_f0003_00158.wav	and I just indulged myself.
f0003_us_f0003_00159.wav	And he was waving a piece of paper
f0003_us_f0003_00160.wav	Well I will give him some money.
f0003_us_f0003_00161.wav	you will get to the top.
f0003_us_f0003_00162.wav	may be much more difficult for the dominant society than
f0003_us_f0003_00163.wav	And that's a good thing because in order to make anything a reality
f0003_us_f0003_00164.wav	political walls have come tumbling down.
f0003_us_f0003_00165.wav	meet people who say things like
f0003_us_f0003_00166.wav	If you're in the communal industry
f0003_us_f0003_00167.wav	there's reasons for optimism.
f0003_us_f0003_00168.wav	we see things not as they are
f0003_us_f0003_00169.wav	And the Reddit community
f0003_us_f0003_00170.wav	Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality
f0003_us_f0003_00171.wav	Every child has known God
f0003_us_f0003_00172.wav	a man I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day
f0003_us_f0003_00173.wav	Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.
f0003_us_f0003_00174.wav	Why does she want to meet us
f0003_us_f0003_00175.wav	And there are lots of those.
f0003_us_f0003_00176.wav	I started looking at the best photos I could find.
f0003_us_f0003_00177.wav	I wouldn't show you this slide.
f0003_us_f0003_00178.wav	and it was a really neat idea
f0003_us_f0003_00179.wav	I had a reputation as being interested in patients with chronic fatigue.
f0003_us_f0003_00180.wav	they play with these little weird particles.
f0003_us_f0003_00181.wav	Now he's really pretty sick.
f0003_us_f0003_00182.wav	It's cells and it's wires all wired together.
f0003_us_f0003_00183.wav	It's cells and it's wires all wired together.
f0003_us_f0003_00184.wav	or saying wait until you're older
f0003_us_f0003_00185.wav	And make sure that we own them
f0003_us_f0003_00186.wav	This is another project I worked on with Sensible Cities Lab and CurrentCity.
f0003_us_f0003_00187.wav	Because it's bad enough
f0003_us_f0003_00188.wav	So if you go to the BicycleBuiltforTwoThousand.
f0003_us_f0003_00189.wav	it's just mind-boggling.
f0003_us_f0003_00190.wav	and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept
f0003_us_f0003_00191.wav	The Black Hills are not for sale.
f0003_us_f0003_00192.wav	We've put all of that together into one thing
f0003_us_f0003_00193.wav	it was an ice-breaker.
f0003_us_f0003_00194.wav	I achieved  a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon.
f0003_us_f0003_00195.wav	But the more I thought about his question
f0003_us_f0003_00196.wav	If you'd been a little more optimistic
f0003_us_f0003_00197.wav	a prognosis on the expected quality of their life
f0003_us_f0003_00198.wav	the more there is a danger of envy.
f0003_us_f0003_00199.wav	so that I have the muscle strength so that when I start to wither
f0003_us_f0003_00200.wav	There is always a better way to do things.
f0003_us_f0003_00201.wav	developing whole new sustainable neighborhoods
f0003_us_f0003_00202.wav	This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh
f0003_us_f0003_00203.wav	suddenly what we find
f0003_us_f0003_00204.wav	This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher
f0003_us_f0003_00205.wav	I can tap into thousands of people's minds.
f0003_us_f0003_00206.wav	I do all sorts of weird things
f0003_us_f0003_00207.wav	The cancer center was wonderful.
f0003_us_f0003_00208.wav	These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.
f0003_us_f0003_00209.wav	not just with the light bulbs.
f0003_us_f0003_00210.wav	So that we can stop compartmentalizing form
f0003_us_f0003_00211.wav	I'm also very nuanced about what that word success might mean.
f0003_us_f0003_00212.wav	It was the best month of my life
f0003_us_f0003_00213.wav	This is looking at another event.
f0003_us_f0003_00214.wav	He was actually an elderly man
f0003_us_f0003_00215.wav	powerful and athletic person well into the future.
f0003_us_f0003_00216.wav	I'd like to talk about my dad.
f0003_us_f0003_00217.wav	It's a sin to judge any man by his post.
f0003_us_f0003_00218.wav	Because all of those cities we're building are opportunities.
f0003_us_f0003_00219.wav	they could actually face the regeneration of that limb.
f0003_us_f0003_00220.wav	where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.
f0003_us_f0003_00221.wav	where you can browse through and see all the individual contributions.
f0003_us_f0003_00222.wav	But less in a century than you expect to see in a year today.
f0003_us_f0003_00223.wav	And I just worked and worked through problems
f0003_us_f0003_00224.wav	we're learning how to include in these systems of notation and navigation.
f0003_us_f0003_00225.wav	and I'm somebody  who is very interested in success.
f0003_us_f0003_00226.wav	I want to suggest to you that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.
f0003_us_f0003_00227.wav	Even in their older years
f0003_us_f0003_00228.wav	And how much of this history do you need to own
f0003_us_f0003_00229.wav	It was more atonal and twelve-tone.
f0003_us_f0003_00230.wav	or something like that
f0003_us_f0003_00231.wav	I don't want to write that stuff.
f0003_us_f0003_00232.wav	but it is lost as we age.
f0003_us_f0003_00233.wav	they form institutions.
f0003_us_f0003_00234.wav	And he was standing in front of me
f0003_us_f0003_00235.wav	Every time the tide comes in and out
f0003_us_f0003_00236.wav	a lot of people answered that call.
f0003_us_f0003_00237.wav	Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes which affect X.
f0003_us_f0003_00238.wav	there's a sluice of stuff moving into there
f0003_us_f0003_00239.wav	and it's enabling us to tell some amazing stories.
f0003_us_f0003_00240.wav	And it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy.
f0003_us_f0003_00241.wav	She started singing her song.
f0003_us_f0003_00242.wav	you're very attractive.
f0003_us_f0003_00243.wav	But the arrival of auscultation and percussion represented a sea change
f0003_us_f0003_00244.wav	So if we are to find any meaning in this book
f0003_us_f0003_00245.wav	because they had been seen in other places.
f0003_us_f0003_00246.wav	How much stuff goes through your life
f0003_us_f0003_00247.wav	It sets things into perspective
f0003_us_f0003_00248.wav	And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.
f0003_us_f0003_00249.wav	the red-eye flights to the East coast.
f0003_us_f0003_00250.wav	because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win.
f0003_us_f0003_00251.wav	sometimes there's very little
f0003_us_f0003_00252.wav	they stand for all indigenous people.
f0003_us_f0003_00253.wav	he began to do the same thing.
f0003_us_f0003_00254.wav	They are sucked in from other people.
f0003_us_f0003_00255.wav	When banking is no longer so respectable
f0003_us_f0003_00256.wav	everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos.
f0003_us_f0003_00257.wav	And at the end of a very testy meeting
f0003_us_f0003_00258.wav	they didn't bury them yet.
f0003_us_f0003_00259.wav	So that's what I've been doing the last couple of years.
f0003_us_f0003_00260.wav	There's this group online that I frequent.
f0003_us_f0003_00261.wav	and look a little longer
f0003_us_f0003_00262.wav	Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking
f0003_us_f0003_00263.wav	suffer from some developmental disorder.
f0003_us_f0003_00264.wav	And the first song I wrote was in English
f0003_us_f0003_00265.wav	so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
f0003_us_f0003_00266.wav	the rich narrative that really engaging video games have
f0003_us_f0003_00267.wav	and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.
f0003_us_f0003_00268.wav	That you're much better off
f0003_us_f0003_00269.wav	there's my master and there's my bronze.
f0003_us_f0003_00270.wav	Planning is incredibly important.
f0003_us_f0003_00271.wav	A walking helmet is a good helmet.
f0003_us_f0003_00272.wav	The focus was around the patient.
f0003_us_f0003_00273.wav	It's an escape from our own competition
f0003_us_f0003_00274.wav	in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped .
f0003_us_f0003_00275.wav	And they can make basically what's a reference atlas.
f0003_us_f0003_00276.wav	I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent
f0003_us_f0003_00277.wav	it's really pretty remarkable.
f0003_us_f0003_00278.wav	use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind
f0003_us_f0003_00279.wav	and it may even slow the progress of the disease.
f0003_us_f0003_00280.wav	Has anybody noticed that
f0003_us_f0003_00281.wav	there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness
f0003_us_f0003_00282.wav	You won't do that by accident
f0003_us_f0003_00283.wav	but rather better adults than you have been
f0003_us_f0003_00284.wav	the beginning of the twenty-first century
f0003_us_f0003_00285.wav	except in terms of when he was born.
f0003_us_f0003_00286.wav	Because there's unique fingerprint
f0003_us_f0003_00287.wav	Look very closely at pilgrimage.
f0003_us_f0003_00288.wav	it expands to the dark blue.
f0003_us_f0003_00289.wav	it startles us in terms of those categorizations.
f0003_us_f0003_00290.wav	and you can get shot by those who fully believe.
f0003_us_f0003_00291.wav	This was one of the huge lessons of the year
f0003_us_f0003_00292.wav	if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow
f0003_us_f0003_00293.wav	who then established the Tate Gallery.
f0003_us_f0003_00294.wav	So let's take a deeper look.
f0003_us_f0003_00295.wav	My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.
f0003_us_f0003_00296.wav	It doesn't see beauty.
f0003_us_f0003_00297.wav	And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible.
f0003_us_f0003_00298.wav	visible target of concern
f0003_us_f0003_00299.wav	what we're talking about is
f0003_us_f0003_00300.wav	which we all have in the fetal life
f0003_us_f0003_00301.wav	because they were concerned about blood clots in the lung.
f0003_us_f0003_00302.wav	who played Wilmer Cook in the movie
f0003_us_f0003_00303.wav	reacting along the way
f0003_us_f0003_00304.wav	But world GDP per capita
f0003_us_f0003_00305.wav	use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit.
f0003_us_f0003_00306.wav	Who here owns a drill
f0003_us_f0003_00307.wav	we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling.
f0003_us_f0003_00308.wav	especially for those around me.
f0003_us_f0003_00309.wav	He says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin
f0003_us_f0003_00310.wav	but it allows me a really
f0003_us_f0003_00311.wav	But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global
f0003_us_f0003_00312.wav	this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible.
f0003_us_f0003_00313.wav	because you can choose what you want to pull out from the data.
f0003_us_f0003_00314.wav	You can also toggle between altitude for model and manufacturer.
f0003_us_f0003_00315.wav	the stuff that's going to run every time.
f0003_us_f0003_00316.wav	very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge
f0003_us_f0003_00317.wav	once it becomes symptomatic
f0003_us_f0003_00318.wav	So people were asking a question.
f0003_us_f0003_00319.wav	He draws sheep after sheep.
f0003_us_f0003_00320.wav	And that day I knew that when I grew up
f0003_us_f0003_00321.wav	from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.
f0003_us_f0003_00322.wav	It's separating students from A
f0003_us_f0003_00323.wav	We go out there and we hop in our cars and we drive from place to place.
f0003_us_f0003_00324.wav	So she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.
f0003_us_f0003_00325.wav	I want to start with this slide
f0003_us_f0003_00326.wav	It's confusing to watch television
f0003_us_f0003_00327.wav	sometimes misunderstood in this context.
f0003_us_f0003_00328.wav	the original anatomical activists
f0003_us_f0003_00329.wav	the original anatomical activists
f0003_us_f0003_00330.wav	Men don't belong here
f0003_us_f0003_00331.wav	if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers
f0003_us_f0003_00332.wav	secular mode of delivery
f0003_us_f0003_00333.wav	but here's what you should do
f0003_us_f0003_00334.wav	besides the people who had dropped out.
f0003_us_f0003_00335.wav	I love Christmas carols.
f0003_us_f0003_00336.wav	figured out the content
f0003_us_f0003_00337.wav	what we've found is that
f0003_us_f0003_00338.wav	and there's all kinds of activity there.
f0003_us_f0003_00339.wav	The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.
f0003_us_f0003_00340.wav	we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part.
f0003_us_f0003_00341.wav	then we're going to have boys who leave elementary school saying
f0003_us_f0003_00342.wav	it's been quite clear what being an atheist means.
f0003_us_f0003_00343.wav	the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon
f0003_us_f0003_00344.wav	This is happening today.
f0003_us_f0003_00345.wav	I like climate crisis instead of climate collapse
f0003_us_f0003_00346.wav	They wanted to put an end to it.
f0003_us_f0003_00347.wav	people like him waiting.
f0003_us_f0003_00348.wav	I see the power of music to connect cultures.
f0003_us_f0003_00349.wav	So they'd created these artifacts.
f0003_us_f0003_00350.wav	believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful
f0003_us_f0003_00351.wav	And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.
f0003_us_f0003_00352.wav	those lands are a sovereign nation.
f0003_us_f0003_00353.wav	and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man
f0003_us_f0003_00354.wav	Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.
f0003_us_f0003_00355.wav	they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it.
f0003_us_f0003_00356.wav	One was scratching at the end of the stick
f0003_us_f0003_00357.wav	They were turned off a long time before they got here.
f0003_us_f0003_00358.wav	Months were spent in this tiny
f0003_us_f0003_00359.wav	she went into cardiac collapse.
f0003_us_f0003_00360.wav	what reality do we want to call into existence
f0003_us_f0003_00361.wav	And so you have to start with it.
f0003_us_f0003_00362.wav	I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
f0003_us_f0003_00363.wav	This is scrolling up the East coast.
f0003_us_f0003_00364.wav	This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.
f0003_us_f0003_00365.wav	that had metastasized widely all over the body.
f0003_us_f0003_00366.wav	that had metastasized widely all over the body.
f0003_us_f0003_00367.wav	They were tired of treaties.
f0003_us_f0003_00368.wav	What have you noticed about what you did
f0003_us_f0003_00369.wav	Well you are describing a classic ritual.
f0003_us_f0003_00370.wav	Well you are describing a classic ritual.
f0003_us_f0003_00371.wav	those of you who are good at branding
f0003_us_f0003_00372.wav	The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.
f0003_us_f0003_00373.wav	The book about it comes out in April.
f0003_us_f0003_00374.wav	To give just one example
f0003_us_f0003_00375.wav	Even though she is much richer than any of you are.
f0003_us_f0003_00376.wav	where the discussion is taking place in a room far away from the patient.
f0003_us_f0003_00377.wav	and I put them on a website called TheSheepMarket.
f0003_us_f0003_00378.wav	Whether it's software
f0003_us_f0003_00379.wav	But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was
f0003_us_f0003_00380.wav	People are willing to invest more
f0003_us_f0003_00381.wav	they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot
f0003_us_f0003_00382.wav	The other things that religions do is to arrange time.
f0003_us_f0003_00383.wav	And this was an amazing year.
f0003_us_f0003_00384.wav	So what's Worldchanging
f0003_us_f0003_00385.wav	I don't know how my friend Mike gets beautiful
f0003_us_f0003_00386.wav	When we think about how we're going to make the world a better place
f0003_us_f0003_00387.wav	not only in the orthopedic center
f0003_us_f0003_00388.wav	So we took these hundred dollar bills
f0003_us_f0003_00389.wav	when they finally bring out the bird at the end
f0003_us_f0003_00390.wav	If it stopped twitching
f0003_us_f0003_00391.wav	that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed.
f0003_us_f0003_00392.wav	I've got so many legs in here.
f0003_us_f0003_00393.wav	Because we live in such a noisy world.
f0003_us_f0003_00394.wav	I know they were racists
f0003_us_f0003_00395.wav	not the God of don'ts
f0003_us_f0003_00396.wav	we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
f0003_us_f0003_00397.wav	I don't remember meeting you.
f0003_us_f0003_00398.wav	But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.
f0003_us_f0003_00399.wav	the one that Hammett created for the book.
f0003_us_f0003_00400.wav	And of course the iron curtains
f0003_us_f0003_00401.wav	And that has all sorts of advantages.
f0003_us_f0003_00402.wav	It provides the framework.
f0003_us_f0003_00403.wav	that maybe I could talk about that another time.
f0003_us_f0003_00404.wav	so just one more quick example of a way you can have intersex.
f0003_us_f0003_00405.wav	Figure out some of the other options that are much better.
f0003_us_f0003_00406.wav	though that may be something
f0003_us_f0003_00407.wav	but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.
f0003_us_f0003_00408.wav	you have responsibilities.
f0003_us_f0003_00409.wav	they were performing at A level.
f0003_us_f0003_00410.wav	Kean went on to tell me
f0003_us_f0003_00411.wav	I just think that it is impossible.
f0003_us_f0003_00412.wav	I really like looking at old churches.
f0003_us_f0003_00413.wav	a different organizational model.
f0003_us_f0003_00414.wav	And I undertook this for two reasons.
f0003_us_f0003_00415.wav	All three have offered leadership
f0003_us_f0003_00416.wav	And they were not alone.
f0003_us_f0003_00417.wav	we saw growth in Africa.
f0003_us_f0003_00418.wav	was walking in the streets of Paris and saw two children playing with a stick.
f0003_us_f0003_00419.wav	that the boys are really interested in.
f0003_us_f0003_00420.wav	And you should see me during the match.
f0003_us_f0003_00421.wav	And most of those classrooms are not places where men exist.
f0003_us_f0003_00422.wav	I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.
f0003_us_f0003_00423.wav	a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption
f0003_us_f0003_00424.wav	but you can buy a single plate block of stamps as a commodity.
f0003_us_f0003_00425.wav	And so what we can do is
f0003_us_f0003_00426.wav	And then the next day
f0003_us_f0003_00427.wav	and it's not because of the music
f0003_us_f0003_00428.wav	I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.
f0003_us_f0003_00429.wav	When you care for someone with dementia
f0003_us_f0003_00430.wav	They had a concept of blue blood.
f0003_us_f0003_00431.wav	and we fed those into the Mechanical Turk.
f0003_us_f0003_00432.wav	that are much more comfortable than standard buildings
f0003_us_f0003_00433.wav	I was never as kind as my dad
f0003_us_f0003_00434.wav	Perhaps a stealth thing.
f0003_us_f0003_00435.wav	And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me.
f0003_us_f0003_00436.wav	in the generation of those alive today
f0003_us_f0003_00437.wav	Conflict is the genesis of creation.
f0003_us_f0003_00438.wav	the stratosphere would be heated as well as the  lower atmosphere
f0003_us_f0003_00439.wav	and coal is the most serious problem.
f0003_us_f0003_00440.wav	unless you're a particle physicist.
f0003_us_f0003_00441.wav	Some people who have XX chromosomes develop what are called ovotestis
f0003_us_f0003_00442.wav	but they did not touch my breasts.
f0003_us_f0003_00443.wav	really for the first time in modern history
f0003_us_f0003_00444.wav	you will be ordered out of your home
f0003_us_f0003_00445.wav	you have to be collaborative.
f0003_us_f0003_00446.wav	and then we put a florescent tag on it.
f0003_us_f0003_00447.wav	I expected people to be wondering
f0003_us_f0003_00448.wav	and you change your behavior
f0003_us_f0003_00449.wav	So my hip had been hurting me for years.
f0003_us_f0003_00450.wav	We take a microscope slide.
f0003_us_f0003_00451.wav	Now they can come in and they can start to get clues about activity.
f0003_us_f0003_00452.wav	and you become emotionally involved in that cause.
f0003_us_f0003_00453.wav	I have never been at the front of the line for anything.
f0003_us_f0003_00454.wav	My favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King.
f0003_us_f0003_00455.wav	You have choices with everything you buy
f0003_us_f0003_00456.wav	And I think that's what helped drive this.
f0003_us_f0003_00457.wav	Lot of other things contributed to it
f0003_us_f0003_00458.wav	And by the time the movie comes out in May
f0003_us_f0003_00459.wav	and I was walking through the hospital
f0004_us_f0004_00001.wav	you have to dream about it first.
f0004_us_f0004_00002.wav	and you see people going to sleep.
f0004_us_f0004_00003.wav	can I take some cells along with the material
f0004_us_f0004_00004.wav	A new sense of urgency.
f0004_us_f0004_00005.wav	He asked the question
f0004_us_f0004_00006.wav	But this one's kind of cool.
f0004_us_f0004_00007.wav	a sense of our own power.
f0004_us_f0004_00008.wav	Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue.
f0004_us_f0004_00009.wav	Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal.
f0004_us_f0004_00010.wav	you would all stand up and you would go
f0004_us_f0004_00011.wav	If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again
f0004_us_f0004_00012.wav	Kids already do a lot of learning from adults
f0004_us_f0004_00013.wav	That's a lovely idea.
f0004_us_f0004_00014.wav	there's the object in the world.
f0004_us_f0004_00015.wav	So without noise reduction technology
f0004_us_f0004_00016.wav	what we would have is more of a concept of
f0004_us_f0004_00017.wav	and this organization
f0004_us_f0004_00018.wav	we have an opportunity
f0004_us_f0004_00019.wav	man-made global warming pollution
f0004_us_f0004_00020.wav	and you've been making liar out of me ever since.
f0004_us_f0004_00021.wav	what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy
f0004_us_f0004_00022.wav	even when controlled for job types
f0004_us_f0004_00023.wav	which is self-improvement.
f0004_us_f0004_00024.wav	The machine itself would start the music.
f0004_us_f0004_00025.wav	which benefits everyone in the world.
f0004_us_f0004_00026.wav	they're highly effective mechanisms for doing so.
f0004_us_f0004_00027.wav	I blew it up to the actual size
f0004_us_f0004_00028.wav	When I'm starting talks like this
f0004_us_f0004_00029.wav	And I should say I think this is a rather modest prediction.
f0004_us_f0004_00030.wav	and yet so incredibly wise in others
f0004_us_f0004_00031.wav	These are massive machines.
f0004_us_f0004_00032.wav	The biggest single cause of global warming
f0004_us_f0004_00033.wav	How was the Bible written
f0004_us_f0004_00034.wav	what it means to be a black person is
f0004_us_f0004_00035.wav	No matter your position of place in life
f0004_us_f0004_00036.wav	hold your horses when you're coming to judge people.
f0004_us_f0004_00037.wav	And if you drop them at the same time
f0004_us_f0004_00038.wav	Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality.
f0004_us_f0004_00039.wav	It should be Go Go Gadget! No
f0004_us_f0004_00040.wav	the greatest preacher
f0004_us_f0004_00041.wav	and that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious
f0004_us_f0004_00042.wav	Now religions have a much saner attitude to art.
f0004_us_f0004_00043.wav	So as you walk around a church
f0004_us_f0004_00044.wav	it like everybody's got a story.
f0004_us_f0004_00045.wav	really got behind this.
f0004_us_f0004_00046.wav	The four corners of the world are watching
f0004_us_f0004_00047.wav	which may be a little challenging considering your guys credentials
f0004_us_f0004_00048.wav	This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic
f0004_us_f0004_00049.wav	This is an annual melting river.
f0004_us_f0004_00050.wav	The reality is that covering Britney is cheaper.
f0004_us_f0004_00051.wav	Things that don't have any wiring in them at all
f0004_us_f0004_00052.wav	We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.
f0004_us_f0004_00053.wav	also just staring at me.
f0004_us_f0004_00054.wav	and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea.
f0004_us_f0004_00055.wav	One of the places we're seeing it
f0004_us_f0004_00056.wav	You've heard of phantom limb pain
f0004_us_f0004_00057.wav	because you don't know who they are.
f0004_us_f0004_00058.wav	told them they were bright.
f0004_us_f0004_00059.wav	There is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser.
f0004_us_f0004_00060.wav	So I thought today I'd do something a little different
f0004_us_f0004_00061.wav	When they come and light their candles at ours
f0004_us_f0004_00062.wav	I believe this is a Farsi word for immortal.
f0004_us_f0004_00063.wav	They are my teachers.
f0004_us_f0004_00064.wav	We need to group together.
f0004_us_f0004_00065.wav	And it was Doc Watson singing and playing Shady Grove.
f0004_us_f0004_00066.wav	and it did allow me to talk about in a more serious way these big issues.
f0004_us_f0004_00067.wav	It's no longer the gods
f0004_us_f0004_00068.wav	Could you regenerate a limb
f0004_us_f0004_00069.wav	the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
f0004_us_f0004_00070.wav	We're looking a lot at this.
f0004_us_f0004_00071.wav	You want to be an Indian now
f0004_us_f0004_00072.wav	but also in the houses of the people.
f0004_us_f0004_00073.wav	And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
f0004_us_f0004_00074.wav	and they're highly disciplined.
f0004_us_f0004_00075.wav	Now help me not to be a beggar anymore.
f0004_us_f0004_00076.wav	And he asked a very important question.
f0004_us_f0004_00077.wav	We do not think that way.
f0004_us_f0004_00078.wav	So when you think about your parents or your grandparents
f0004_us_f0004_00079.wav	They don't think we need it.
f0004_us_f0004_00080.wav	so that my suffering is something positive for other women.
f0004_us_f0004_00081.wav	look at how religions are spreading ideas.
f0004_us_f0004_00082.wav	we're assaying genes.
f0004_us_f0004_00083.wav	a dermatitis that is unique to the linoleum factory workers in Burntisland.
f0004_us_f0004_00084.wav	Low-cost family restaurant chain
f0004_us_f0004_00085.wav	Where she wasn't sure what six times six was
f0004_us_f0004_00086.wav	And being the youngest of seven
f0004_us_f0004_00087.wav	is losing its idea leadership.
f0004_us_f0004_00088.wav	We're all basically equal.
f0004_us_f0004_00089.wav	One has a working fluid
f0004_us_f0004_00090.wav	that Darwin illustrated
f0004_us_f0004_00091.wav	That is what free gets you.
f0004_us_f0004_00092.wav	because I've been interested in intersex
f0004_us_f0004_00093.wav	in his film opus called the The Cremaster Cycle.
f0004_us_f0004_00094.wav	We're only just holding it together.
f0004_us_f0004_00095.wav	I didn't like that at all.
f0004_us_f0004_00096.wav	Most of these expenditures are also profitable.
f0004_us_f0004_00097.wav	many of the people you've seen on this stage.
f0004_us_f0004_00098.wav	Clearly the images kind of get that across.
f0004_us_f0004_00099.wav	Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.
f0004_us_f0004_00100.wav	if you can't heal it.
f0004_us_f0004_00101.wav	And we get confirmation.
f0004_us_f0004_00102.wav	This is not a reputation you would wish on your worst enemy.
f0004_us_f0004_00103.wav	This is just for the United States of America.
f0004_us_f0004_00104.wav	I've had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country.
f0004_us_f0004_00105.wav	at the beginning of the twenty-first century
f0004_us_f0004_00106.wav	And the orthopedic center was closed.
f0004_us_f0004_00107.wav	Now there's a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish.
f0004_us_f0004_00108.wav	If I essentialize gender for you today
f0004_us_f0004_00109.wav	home education for those who cannot go to school.
f0004_us_f0004_00110.wav	What an exciting and inspiring event.
f0004_us_f0004_00111.wav	I think it's a crazy idea
f0004_us_f0004_00112.wav	But it's part of the puzzle.
f0004_us_f0004_00113.wav	and I looked and there was a man running across the runway.
f0004_us_f0004_00114.wav	It's part of our life.
f0004_us_f0004_00115.wav	So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music
f0004_us_f0004_00116.wav	had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.
f0004_us_f0004_00117.wav	After Justin was given anti-seizure medication
f0004_us_f0004_00118.wav	I'm nervous enough as it is.
f0004_us_f0004_00119.wav	I've actually coined a term for that entity in the computer.
f0004_us_f0004_00120.wav	These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine.
f0004_us_f0004_00121.wav	and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way
f0004_us_f0004_00122.wav	would look like today.
f0004_us_f0004_00123.wav	If you roll over any one of those individual thumbnails
f0004_us_f0004_00124.wav	Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it.
f0004_us_f0004_00125.wav	she actually has testes inside
f0004_us_f0004_00126.wav	not getting what you want.
f0004_us_f0004_00127.wav	and how you view brands.
f0004_us_f0004_00128.wav	understanding why we're here
f0004_us_f0004_00129.wav	So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are
f0004_us_f0004_00130.wav	Water's one of the most pressing problems.
f0004_us_f0004_00131.wav	And they say these things as if it's okay.
f0004_us_f0004_00132.wav	and the existence of low self-esteem.
f0004_us_f0004_00133.wav	And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it
f0004_us_f0004_00134.wav	now the average person is looking at diabetes
f0004_us_f0004_00135.wav	we need to think a little differently.
f0004_us_f0004_00136.wav	So about a hundred years ago
f0004_us_f0004_00137.wav	easier for their caregivers to look after
f0004_us_f0004_00138.wav	Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere
f0004_us_f0004_00139.wav	And we're very careful about the brains that we do take.
f0004_us_f0004_00140.wav	There's trains and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly
f0004_us_f0004_00141.wav	The rest of the time they're delocalized.
f0004_us_f0004_00142.wav	we need to structure time
f0004_us_f0004_00143.wav	Why did I draw a sheep
f0004_us_f0004_00144.wav	And I was a guinea pig and
f0004_us_f0004_00145.wav	We're already an urban planet
f0004_us_f0004_00146.wav	say in making the rules
f0004_us_f0004_00147.wav	He was clearly embarrassed.
f0004_us_f0004_00148.wav	and very crushing if you're not.
f0004_us_f0004_00149.wav	or else we'll consider it a developmental delay.
f0004_us_f0004_00150.wav	But it's even worse to have an idea of what it is you want
f0004_us_f0004_00151.wav	check your Blackberry
f0004_us_f0004_00152.wav	you could submit it into the Mechanical Turk with no other context.
f0004_us_f0004_00153.wav	I knew I had to take a banjo with me to China.
f0004_us_f0004_00154.wav	and a greater supply of ideas for the world.
f0004_us_f0004_00155.wav	It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.
f0004_us_f0004_00156.wav	they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar
f0004_us_f0004_00157.wav	killed James Elroy's mother.
f0004_us_f0004_00158.wav	don't stare at her legs.
f0004_us_f0004_00159.wav	if you're a secularist person
f0004_us_f0004_00160.wav	which is to get a bunch of stuff
f0004_us_f0004_00161.wav	it's pretty unintelligible.
f0004_us_f0004_00162.wav	You can see this in the data.
f0004_us_f0004_00163.wav	For the Hollywood people in the audience
f0004_us_f0004_00164.wav	You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.
f0004_us_f0004_00165.wav	I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder
f0004_us_f0004_00166.wav	what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature
f0004_us_f0004_00167.wav	I met Mahmoud one year later.
f0004_us_f0004_00168.wav	the kids descend on this table of legs
f0004_us_f0004_00169.wav	divided between two floors.
f0004_us_f0004_00170.wav	So that may be a very direct way that we see it happen.
f0004_us_f0004_00171.wav	if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs
f0004_us_f0004_00172.wav	I think it's too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way.
f0004_us_f0004_00173.wav	How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space
f0004_us_f0004_00174.wav	where we found people like Sojourner Truth talking about
f0004_us_f0004_00175.wav	Two groups of Mujahideen started fighting.
f0004_us_f0004_00176.wav	a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.
f0004_us_f0004_00177.wav	It's not your business what they do with them.
f0004_us_f0004_00178.wav	By the time you're in first grade
f0004_us_f0004_00179.wav	that artists shouldn't say what they're up to
f0004_us_f0004_00180.wav	So that's one problem.
f0004_us_f0004_00181.wav	and incredibly challenging.
f0004_us_f0004_00182.wav	And then I asked for verification.
f0004_us_f0004_00183.wav	we were just providing them with artificial limbs.
f0004_us_f0004_00184.wav	shiny surfaces with his Sculpey
f0004_us_f0004_00185.wav	And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me.
f0004_us_f0004_00186.wav	there's no problem with it at all.
f0004_us_f0004_00187.wav	and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it
f0004_us_f0004_00188.wav	There's a limb prosthetic up here
f0004_us_f0004_00189.wav	maybe a little cheap shot
f0004_us_f0004_00190.wav	we're basically sort of wallowing
f0004_us_f0004_00191.wav	A number of governments
f0004_us_f0004_00192.wav	We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.
f0004_us_f0004_00193.wav	it's about the systems below.
f0004_us_f0004_00194.wav	to make them part of the decision-making process and then
f0004_us_f0004_00195.wav	That's my greatest hope.
f0004_us_f0004_00196.wav	That's my greatest hope.
f0004_us_f0004_00197.wav	which is the logical side
f0004_us_f0004_00198.wav	I would look at the tongue.
f0004_us_f0004_00199.wav	whether it's camel dung or wood.
f0004_us_f0004_00200.wav	is that I almost pretended to be a better person
f0004_us_f0004_00201.wav	nobody is talking on that scale.
f0004_us_f0004_00202.wav	since this is a tech crowd
f0004_us_f0004_00203.wav	while you're playing it
f0004_us_f0004_00204.wav	Now education is a field the secular world really believes in.
f0004_us_f0004_00205.wav	but at the end of the day
f0004_us_f0004_00206.wav	We need all sorts of new technology
f0004_us_f0004_00207.wav	I want to repeat that part.
f0004_us_f0004_00208.wav	but how you're going to meet it.
f0004_us_f0004_00209.wav	And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.
f0004_us_f0004_00210.wav	but it was also science growing up at the same time.
f0004_us_f0004_00211.wav	a default out of that
f0004_us_f0004_00212.wav	I would percuss the chest.
f0004_us_f0004_00213.wav	Artists and innovators
f0004_us_f0004_00214.wav	Greenpeace was thrilled.
f0004_us_f0004_00215.wav	You put it on a cooking fire.
f0004_us_f0004_00216.wav	What we're finding is that what we want is access to the capacities of things.
f0004_us_f0004_00217.wav	So this should really be seen at home with you typing in your own address
f0004_us_f0004_00218.wav	selling it in the present and call it GDP.
f0004_us_f0004_00219.wav	And the point is that
f0004_us_f0004_00220.wav	The new is better than the old.
f0004_us_f0004_00221.wav	even though I disagree with much of what they say.
f0004_us_f0004_00222.wav	how do we maximize that incentive
f0004_us_f0004_00223.wav	It's a completely different way of doing it.
f0004_us_f0004_00224.wav	And this lady decided
f0004_us_f0004_00225.wav	circling around the sun.
f0004_us_f0004_00226.wav	And the other nerdy side of me thought
f0004_us_f0004_00227.wav	there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies.
f0004_us_f0004_00228.wav	or design and architecture community.
f0004_us_f0004_00229.wav	they became asymptomatic.
f0004_us_f0004_00230.wav	I told him Come tomorrow.
f0004_us_f0004_00231.wav	prevented by the fighting.
f0004_us_f0004_00232.wav	all kinds of trends get born right on our front page.
f0004_us_f0004_00233.wav	to sort of help the cause.
f0004_us_f0004_00234.wav	And hence the painting The Doctor
f0004_us_f0004_00235.wav	this shouldn't be partisan.
f0004_us_f0004_00236.wav	Here's a way of transporting water.
f0004_us_f0004_00237.wav	so when I stand in these legs
f0004_us_f0004_00238.wav	So we're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life.
f0004_us_f0004_00239.wav	so does much of the drinking water.
f0004_us_f0004_00240.wav	Because living so healthily was killing me.
f0004_us_f0004_00241.wav	if they lose their fingertip in an accident
f0004_us_f0004_00242.wav	it's trying to remind you of what there is to love.
f0004_us_f0004_00243.wav	Now religions start from a very different place indeed.
f0004_us_f0004_00244.wav	So I wear two hats in most of what I do.
f0004_us_f0004_00245.wav	We have visions like this.
f0004_us_f0004_00246.wav	I finally went to the doctor
f0004_us_f0004_00247.wav	than ever in the past
f0004_us_f0004_00248.wav	there might be something
f0004_us_f0004_00249.wav	And I asked them to write the headline for the story of Othello.
f0004_us_f0004_00250.wav	you could get your tummy-tuck.
f0004_us_f0004_00251.wav	Another that ended slavery.
f0004_us_f0004_00252.wav	it's a true condemnation of our health care system
f0004_us_f0004_00253.wav	a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S.
f0004_us_f0004_00254.wav	and at eight frames a second
f0004_us_f0004_00255.wav	So I wasted some time there.
f0004_us_f0004_00256.wav	and this is the way it works.
f0004_us_f0004_00257.wav	the silicon sheath I roll over to keep it on which
f0004_us_f0004_00258.wav	Taking it a step further
f0004_us_f0004_00259.wav	not just how to protect
f0004_us_f0004_00260.wav	If you want to change the world
f0004_us_f0004_00261.wav	He's affordable and adorable
f0004_us_f0004_00262.wav	Globalization is increasing the demand for ideas
f0004_us_f0004_00263.wav	of the Maltese Falcon on eBay
f0004_us_f0004_00264.wav	Now if that were true
f0004_us_f0004_00265.wav	having collected a couple of hundred.
f0004_us_f0004_00266.wav	his naked heart still shines.
f0004_us_f0004_00267.wav	Weighs about eight pounds
f0004_us_f0004_00268.wav	Buckminster Fuller once wrote
f0004_us_f0004_00269.wav	what the NIH director said is
f0004_us_f0004_00270.wav	I went to the creationists' museum.
f0004_us_f0004_00271.wav	IBM has responsibilities
f0004_us_f0004_00272.wav	and she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon
f0004_us_f0004_00273.wav	the more expensive it is  to take care of our diseases as we get older.
f0004_us_f0004_00274.wav	I want to write about this really interesting world.
f0004_us_f0004_00275.wav	They were moving away from supernatural explanations
f0004_us_f0004_00276.wav	So I wanted to follow those.
f0004_us_f0004_00277.wav	Mahmoud was the fastest in the production line.
f0004_us_f0004_00278.wav	I will be with you through the end.
f0004_us_f0004_00279.wav	by not doing a complete exam
f0004_us_f0004_00280.wav	Here's what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers.
f0004_us_f0004_00281.wav	the ways the airports change.
f0004_us_f0004_00282.wav	This is a bio-morphic building.
f0004_us_f0004_00283.wav	We think very highly of ourselves.
f0004_us_f0004_00284.wav	and it's shaped like a diving board
f0004_us_f0004_00285.wav	And it really opened my eyes to this conversation  that could be explored
f0004_us_f0004_00286.wav	I grabbed all the reference
f0004_us_f0004_00287.wav	a speaker finds this complex
f0004_us_f0004_00288.wav	whatever has happened in their lives
f0004_us_f0004_00289.wav	how much money do I have in my pocket
f0004_us_f0004_00290.wav	which is just turning around there.
f0004_us_f0004_00291.wav	I wanted it to be about religion in America.
f0004_us_f0004_00292.wav	In the secular world we think
f0004_us_f0004_00293.wav	I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby  with these unruly kids
f0004_us_f0004_00294.wav	So first I started with the mind.
f0004_us_f0004_00295.wav	when we're traveling abroad
f0004_us_f0004_00296.wav	I just drag these guys out and set them going.
f0004_us_f0004_00297.wav	Now we're not there yet.
f0004_us_f0004_00298.wav	How else can we create new ideas
f0004_us_f0004_00299.wav	We are at a private school in the American West
f0004_us_f0004_00300.wav	I wrote the book on a treadmill
f0004_us_f0004_00301.wav	Now all of these are fine projects
f0004_us_f0004_00302.wav	they actually spin it.
f0004_us_f0004_00303.wav	because if they said it
f0004_us_f0004_00304.wav	and it's sticking out over a ledge.
f0004_us_f0004_00305.wav	those pretty broad outlines.
f0004_us_f0004_00306.wav	It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic.
f0004_us_f0004_00307.wav	they started fighting.
f0004_us_f0004_00308.wav	that's pretty obvious.
f0004_us_f0004_00309.wav	or fighting a famine.
f0004_us_f0004_00310.wav	I work for Esquire magazine
f0004_us_f0004_00311.wav	So one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit.
f0004_us_f0004_00312.wav	it's trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate.
f0004_us_f0004_00313.wav	what you're trying to imbibe
f0004_us_f0004_00314.wav	Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two.
f0004_us_f0004_00315.wav	they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose
f0004_us_f0004_00316.wav	you'll want to be heard just like my generation.
f0004_us_f0004_00317.wav	and I happened across the Maltese Falcon.
f0004_us_f0004_00318.wav	when they light their candles at ours
f0004_us_f0004_00319.wav	And people simply do not have enough to survive.
f0004_us_f0004_00320.wav	but it's a great story.
f0004_us_f0004_00321.wav	I talk about things that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of
f0004_us_f0004_00322.wav	meeting the X chromosome of the egg.
f0004_us_f0004_00323.wav	Sit them in a classroom
f0004_us_f0004_00324.wav	but Pioneer Germ Fighters totally rules.
f0004_us_f0004_00325.wav	I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd
f0004_us_f0004_00326.wav	They have a pamphlet that says
f0004_us_f0004_00327.wav	And so for those who are undaunted
f0004_us_f0004_00328.wav	How do we help people like that
f0004_us_f0004_00329.wav	So I took him into a safe place.
f0004_us_f0004_00330.wav	Well I'm not a particularly brave person
f0004_us_f0004_00331.wav	when they could be feeding the world
f0004_us_f0004_00332.wav	in effective and reasonably comfortable manners.
f0004_us_f0004_00333.wav	it will pretty much get where it needs to go.
f0004_us_f0004_00334.wav	My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's
f0004_us_f0004_00335.wav	I was ready to tell him
f0004_us_f0004_00336.wav	as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin
f0004_us_f0004_00337.wav	The legs were swollen and the knees were stiff
f0004_us_f0004_00338.wav	and I scaled them out to the size of the skull.
f0004_us_f0004_00339.wav	for the internally displaced people.
f0004_us_f0004_00340.wav	net before it's too late.
f0004_us_f0004_00341.wav	just like what Al Gore had
f0004_us_f0004_00342.wav	I'm doing weight-bearing exercise
f0004_us_f0004_00343.wav	But I've become increasingly interested in religion.
f0004_us_f0004_00344.wav	So growth can wash away even what appears to be a great depression.
f0004_us_f0004_00345.wav	a really crappy replica
f0004_us_f0004_00346.wav	the incentive to create new ideas.
f0004_us_f0004_00347.wav	And she was reluctant to tell me.
f0004_us_f0004_00348.wav	And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go.
f0004_us_f0004_00349.wav	We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.
f0004_us_f0004_00350.wav	but it is exactly the same size as the United States
f0004_us_f0004_00351.wav	Because the solution seems so far in the past
f0004_us_f0004_00352.wav	then you get all the way down to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region
f0004_us_f0004_00353.wav	It's just incredible.
f0004_us_f0004_00354.wav	There is another source of solace and comfort for all this.
f0004_us_f0004_00355.wav	So let's think about the atoms.
f0004_us_f0004_00356.wav	It's incumbent upon us
f0004_us_f0004_00357.wav	Because in the last four years we've seen all kinds of memes
f0004_us_f0004_00358.wav	we should all vote this up.
f0004_us_f0004_00359.wav	it leads to increased rates of suicide.
f0004_us_f0004_00360.wav	which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places.
f0004_us_f0004_00361.wav	How do we develop this intuition
f0004_us_f0004_00362.wav	Somebody said the test we're facing now
f0004_us_f0004_00363.wav	evangelical Christianity
f0004_us_f0004_00364.wav	Now what do those differences look like
f0004_us_f0004_00365.wav	but it was not always like this.
f0004_us_f0004_00366.wav	If we can change the dynamic
f0004_us_f0004_00367.wav	And when we have overwhelming problems in front of us
f0004_us_f0004_00368.wav	vague possibility out there
f0004_us_f0004_00369.wav	and in a far more nasty way
f0004_us_f0004_00370.wav	And they get depressed and they get sad on their own.
f0004_us_f0004_00371.wav	The suffering of indigenous peoples is not a simple issue to fix.
f0004_us_f0004_00372.wav	And you get water solutions.
f0004_us_f0004_00373.wav	Transportation walls came tumbling down.
f0004_us_f0004_00374.wav	They've done a lot of good for girls in these situations.
f0004_us_f0004_00375.wav	and maybe even an obligation
f0004_us_f0004_00376.wav	They're all about transformation.
f0004_us_f0004_00377.wav	that sounds like a really good idea.
f0004_us_f0004_00378.wav	I was able to do a thorough physical
f0004_us_f0004_00379.wav	But it was kind of an interesting thought.
f0004_us_f0004_00380.wav	as you can see evidenced by such examples
f0004_us_f0004_00381.wav	If you said to a modern liberal individualist
f0004_us_f0004_00382.wav	Everybody is wearing jeans
f0004_us_f0004_00383.wav	And as a teacher of medicine
f0004_us_f0004_00384.wav	and remove a damaged piece of tissue
f0004_us_f0004_00385.wav	but connected to the ideas that are here
f0004_us_f0004_00386.wav	I left him with my sister at Leith.
f0004_us_f0004_00387.wav	the other one is common.
f0004_us_f0004_00388.wav	and a lot of light and dark comes into it.
f0004_us_f0004_00389.wav	all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.
f0004_us_f0004_00390.wav	where are they going to find guidance
f0004_us_f0004_00391.wav	Consider sending somebody to Nashville.
f0004_us_f0004_00392.wav	She comes from an odd place.
f0004_us_f0004_00393.wav	we purify the RNA out of it using some basic technology
f0004_us_f0004_00394.wav	I set off to do just that.
f0004_us_f0004_00395.wav	really expressed this quite well.
f0004_us_f0004_00396.wav	that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding.
f0004_us_f0004_00397.wav	So this is Oblivion by Astor Piazzolla.
f0004_us_f0004_00398.wav	He began to tap on the chests of his patients
f0004_us_f0004_00399.wav	And then I understood
f0004_us_f0004_00400.wav	and help stop global warming.
f0004_us_f0004_00401.wav	Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins
f0004_us_f0004_00402.wav	And indeed start caring so much about material goods.
f0004_us_f0004_00403.wav	You immerse yourself in the water
f0004_us_f0004_00404.wav	we're only just holding it together.
f0004_us_f0004_00405.wav	she started out the journey with two children
f0004_us_f0004_00406.wav	And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.
f0004_us_f0004_00407.wav	I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing
f0004_us_f0004_00408.wav	It expands in winter and contracts in summer.
f0004_us_f0004_00409.wav	They've ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement.
f0004_us_f0004_00410.wav	And so that's what we did.
f0004_us_f0004_00411.wav	like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible
f0004_us_f0004_00412.wav	and the second one was in Chinese.
f0004_us_f0004_00413.wav	our country would not exist.
f0004_us_f0004_00414.wav	if you think it already hasn't.
f0004_us_f0004_00415.wav	For me they normally happen
f0004_us_f0004_00416.wav	if they're not harmful
f0004_us_f0004_00417.wav	where I hired a team of people in Bangalore
f0004_us_f0004_00418.wav	I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.
f0004_us_f0004_00419.wav	and I became a little bit of a better person.
f0004_us_f0004_00420.wav	The bad news is we don't know exactly what's causing this
f0004_us_f0004_00421.wav	They've taken the wrong substance.
f0004_us_f0004_00422.wav	his brain was subject to the more typical masculine component of hormones.
f0004_us_f0004_00423.wav	And then he added something I will never forget for the rest of my life.
f0004_us_f0004_00424.wav	It became a policy of positive discrimination
f0004_us_f0004_00425.wav	What does this mean for the future of mankind
f0004_us_f0004_00426.wav	we'd need between five
f0004_us_f0004_00427.wav	It's very powerful work.
f0004_us_f0004_00428.wav	What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.
f0004_us_f0004_00429.wav	Out comes the liposuction fluid
f0004_us_f0004_00430.wav	At such and such a date
f0004_us_f0004_00431.wav	the results can be somewhat comical.
f0004_us_f0004_00432.wav	So I'm going to put the slide up now.
f0004_us_f0004_00433.wav	So here we can see the white represents low altitudes
f0004_us_f0004_00434.wav	that got us a little angry.
f0004_us_f0004_00435.wav	Communal ownership of reservation lands ends.
f0004_us_f0004_00436.wav	Here's an insight that I've had about success.
f0004_us_f0004_00437.wav	And if you measure very
f0004_us_f0004_00438.wav	appreciating them and diving into them.
f0004_us_f0004_00439.wav	So here I had this Falcon
f0004_us_f0004_00440.wav	Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.
f0004_us_f0004_00441.wav	but humbled by the complexity of the brain
f0004_us_f0004_00442.wav	Art should be didactic.
f0004_us_f0004_00443.wav	To put it in perspective
f0004_us_f0004_00444.wav	have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.
f0004_us_f0004_00445.wav	It is possible and it is not difficult.
f0004_us_f0004_00446.wav	We provide the patients
f0005_us_f0005_00001.wav	There is a real correlationship
f0005_us_f0005_00002.wav	she has a dermatitis on the fingers of her right hand
f0005_us_f0005_00003.wav	This is an opportunity.
f0005_us_f0005_00004.wav	rounds look very much like this
f0005_us_f0005_00005.wav	He made no attempt at diagnosis.
f0005_us_f0005_00006.wav	But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down.
f0005_us_f0005_00007.wav	that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.
f0005_us_f0005_00008.wav	A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible
f0005_us_f0005_00009.wav	But because it's an escape from the human anthill.
f0005_us_f0005_00010.wav	my first night out on the town
f0005_us_f0005_00011.wav	Cars and trucks are very significant
f0005_us_f0005_00012.wav	all of those proteins are encoded by our genomes.
f0005_us_f0005_00013.wav	we obviously need brains.
f0005_us_f0005_00014.wav	beige person if they existed
f0005_us_f0005_00015.wav	because we're understanding that we need to do more than we are.
f0005_us_f0005_00016.wav	It's been on calendars
f0005_us_f0005_00017.wav	My response to him was
f0005_us_f0005_00018.wav	Let's imagine one of them
f0005_us_f0005_00019.wav	Her mouth dropped open when she saw me
f0005_us_f0005_00020.wav	but together we can change his appetite.
f0005_us_f0005_00021.wav	And this was the final vote.
f0005_us_f0005_00022.wav	It's doing something new.
f0005_us_f0005_00023.wav	so seeds that could save your life.
f0005_us_f0005_00024.wav	Then there is the fictional bird
f0005_us_f0005_00025.wav	I think you're going to break one of those bands.
f0005_us_f0005_00026.wav	is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.
f0005_us_f0005_00027.wav	everybody is the same.
f0005_us_f0005_00028.wav	We don't have that kind of situation.
f0005_us_f0005_00029.wav	because it's a pattern matching exercise.
f0005_us_f0005_00030.wav	So we can't relate to her.
f0005_us_f0005_00031.wav	And in the other case
f0005_us_f0005_00032.wav	use all-natural light
f0005_us_f0005_00033.wav	much better than the average crowd
f0005_us_f0005_00034.wav	I was also influenced by another experience that I had
f0005_us_f0005_00035.wav	not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff.
f0005_us_f0005_00036.wav	as well as cognitive symptoms.
f0005_us_f0005_00037.wav	function and aesthetic
f0005_us_f0005_00038.wav	Everybody's moving from the East coast to the West coast.
f0005_us_f0005_00039.wav	The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.
f0005_us_f0005_00040.wav	You would think that person might have made a lot of money
f0005_us_f0005_00041.wav	It's really important to look at the Moon.
f0005_us_f0005_00042.wav	Implicit in this phrase of overcoming adversity
f0005_us_f0005_00043.wav	not so much overcoming adversity
f0005_us_f0005_00044.wav	But we were all so nervous.
f0005_us_f0005_00045.wav	makes this neat sound when you jump around on it.
f0005_us_f0005_00046.wav	And now to introduce their music video
f0005_us_f0005_00047.wav	In order to be optimistic about this
f0005_us_f0005_00048.wav	So if you're in drug discovery
f0005_us_f0005_00049.wav	It's when we warmed it up
f0005_us_f0005_00050.wav	I know she really cried for her son.
f0005_us_f0005_00051.wav	This is age versus cost of health care.
f0005_us_f0005_00052.wav	And they helped me understand that rituals are all about transformation.
f0005_us_f0005_00053.wav	However there is a political battle in our country.
f0005_us_f0005_00054.wav	and we have the lowest standards in the world
f0005_us_f0005_00055.wav	So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen.
f0005_us_f0005_00056.wav	Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions
f0005_us_f0005_00057.wav	am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper.
f0005_us_f0005_00058.wav	I'm not interested in doing that.
f0005_us_f0005_00059.wav	And also according them a level of sympathy.
f0005_us_f0005_00060.wav	Well how else can we create new ideas
f0005_us_f0005_00061.wav	We call it tracking here in the States.
f0005_us_f0005_00062.wav	outside the context of the film
f0005_us_f0005_00063.wav	to see beauty in themselves and others
f0005_us_f0005_00064.wav	most of it  is in the atmosphere.
f0005_us_f0005_00065.wav	if you're in the travel industry
f0005_us_f0005_00066.wav	The move destroyed the reservations
f0005_us_f0005_00067.wav	of that clinical era.
f0005_us_f0005_00068.wav	doesn't matter what's in its way
f0005_us_f0005_00069.wav	to bring out potential.
f0005_us_f0005_00070.wav	we had embraced and wept.
f0005_us_f0005_00071.wav	It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.
f0005_us_f0005_00072.wav	and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it
f0005_us_f0005_00073.wav	Many of you may have heard of the Lakota
f0005_us_f0005_00074.wav	I knew I would find her someday
f0005_us_f0005_00075.wav	I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
f0005_us_f0005_00076.wav	I can make a really great box.
f0005_us_f0005_00077.wav	It was really a life-changing project.
f0005_us_f0005_00078.wav	then you can dismiss what I have to say.
f0005_us_f0005_00079.wav	as it is opening ourselves up to it
f0005_us_f0005_00080.wav	do anything other than look at the screen.
f0005_us_f0005_00081.wav	people are actually perfectly healthy.
f0005_us_f0005_00082.wav	and he helps our economy grow.
f0005_us_f0005_00083.wav	in my home in Tennessee
f0005_us_f0005_00084.wav	And even at this point
f0005_us_f0005_00085.wav	There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
f0005_us_f0005_00086.wav	if you threw away all the cells
f0005_us_f0005_00087.wav	And I went to see The Sunday Sport
f0005_us_f0005_00088.wav	his hands moved as if in slow motion.
f0005_us_f0005_00089.wav	the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves.
f0005_us_f0005_00090.wav	And higher oil prices mean a greater incentive to invest in energy R&D.
f0005_us_f0005_00091.wav	with taking out the best sides of religion.
f0005_us_f0005_00092.wav	then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved.
f0005_us_f0005_00093.wav	One is the beginning of the music video.
f0005_us_f0005_00094.wav	Most of the educational games do not.
f0005_us_f0005_00095.wav	Majora mentioned this.
f0005_us_f0005_00096.wav	It's involved in learning and memory.
f0005_us_f0005_00097.wav	at least you know you don't have to reset the whole thing.
f0005_us_f0005_00098.wav	a series of events was set in motion by a people who look like me
f0005_us_f0005_00099.wav	He would have a great time.
f0005_us_f0005_00100.wav	And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team
f0005_us_f0005_00101.wav	instead of using material
f0005_us_f0005_00102.wav	And it turned out that one of the guys there
f0005_us_f0005_00103.wav	so he needed a long preparation.
f0005_us_f0005_00104.wav	But if it were your culture
f0005_us_f0005_00105.wav	this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
f0005_us_f0005_00106.wav	to live my life for me.
f0005_us_f0005_00107.wav	Earth and Venus  are exactly the same size.
f0005_us_f0005_00108.wav	This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.
f0005_us_f0005_00109.wav	and then the next one.
f0005_us_f0005_00110.wav	I appreciate your attention today
f0005_us_f0005_00111.wav	I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision
f0005_us_f0005_00112.wav	That's a lot of people.
f0005_us_f0005_00113.wav	But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties.
f0005_us_f0005_00114.wav	so you can see the diversity of aircraft that are in the skies above us.
f0005_us_f0005_00115.wav	At the other end of the planet
f0005_us_f0005_00116.wav	which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.
f0005_us_f0005_00117.wav	it's going to be right around this point you'll actually see a back-flush.
f0005_us_f0005_00118.wav	This is a more detailed map.
f0005_us_f0005_00119.wav	postage stamps in many different countries.
f0005_us_f0005_00120.wav	Especially if you're me
f0005_us_f0005_00121.wav	But eventually it stops working
f0005_us_f0005_00122.wav	They are sure that parents and administrators will never accept anything.
f0005_us_f0005_00123.wav	despite all the advances in medical technology
f0005_us_f0005_00124.wav	I'm here today to show my photographs of the Lakota.
f0005_us_f0005_00125.wav	meeting that X chromosome of the egg.
f0005_us_f0005_00126.wav	I'm going to show you an example of each of these
f0005_us_f0005_00127.wav	everyday objects around us.
f0005_us_f0005_00128.wav	and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world.
f0005_us_f0005_00129.wav	and they were interested in a concept of a naturalistic world.
f0005_us_f0005_00130.wav	some of us have done that
f0005_us_f0005_00131.wav	So I rather like this picture here.
f0005_us_f0005_00132.wav	you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us.
f0005_us_f0005_00133.wav	And influential voices came up with one answer.
f0005_us_f0005_00134.wav	So the red levels are where a gene is turned on to a great degree.
f0005_us_f0005_00135.wav	and the rest of the internet
f0005_us_f0005_00136.wav	and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did
f0005_us_f0005_00137.wav	I hope that that turns out to be true.
f0005_us_f0005_00138.wav	is turned into methane by microbes.
f0005_us_f0005_00139.wav	here's what we should do.
f0005_us_f0005_00140.wav	This process for any given brain.
f0005_us_f0005_00141.wav	We need a greater demand for ideas
f0005_us_f0005_00142.wav	an intellectual posture.
f0005_us_f0005_00143.wav	She was the editor then of a magazine called ID
f0005_us_f0005_00144.wav	I am a scrap of a man
f0005_us_f0005_00145.wav	Prozac and Wellbutrin.
f0005_us_f0005_00146.wav	I may be a little taller.
f0005_us_f0005_00147.wav	This is the fifth prototype.
f0005_us_f0005_00148.wav	So here's what we're doing.
f0005_us_f0005_00149.wav	and it was a success in a sense.
f0005_us_f0005_00150.wav	We like to feel in contact with something that is non-human.
f0005_us_f0005_00151.wav	This is not regenerative medicine.
f0005_us_f0005_00152.wav	Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.
f0005_us_f0005_00153.wav	and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome tells the proto-gonads
f0005_us_f0005_00154.wav	and they started practicing for the last time before being discharged.
f0005_us_f0005_00155.wav	if it isn't Aimee Mullins.
f0005_us_f0005_00156.wav	Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful
f0005_us_f0005_00157.wav	I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity
f0005_us_f0005_00158.wav	And the good news is that we can.
f0005_us_f0005_00159.wav	Facebook applications were getting created.
f0005_us_f0005_00160.wav	growth extended to almost all parts of the world.
f0005_us_f0005_00161.wav	And after a few months I was writing songs.
f0005_us_f0005_00162.wav	I wish I could find the words to convey this.
f0005_us_f0005_00163.wav	we have indeed taken the best part of the meat.
f0005_us_f0005_00164.wav	which means we're going to be taking care of you when you're old and senile.
f0005_us_f0005_00165.wav	you have a shell design which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan
f0005_us_f0005_00166.wav	This maps the large cabling in the brain.
f0005_us_f0005_00167.wav	But we're beginning to see a sea change.
f0005_us_f0005_00168.wav	before we had our medications
f0005_us_f0005_00169.wav	it becomes easier to share them.
f0005_us_f0005_00170.wav	This makes university administrators very nervous
f0005_us_f0005_00171.wav	and that girls have continued to struggle in math and science for years.
f0005_us_f0005_00172.wav	And little moments in my life.
f0005_us_f0005_00173.wav	So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.
f0005_us_f0005_00174.wav	grandparents are raising their grandchildren because parents
f0005_us_f0005_00175.wav	Let's probe away at our notions of success.
f0005_us_f0005_00176.wav	What's that girl doing
f0005_us_f0005_00177.wav	So I think we have to be in the lead.
f0005_us_f0005_00178.wav	And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now
f0005_us_f0005_00179.wav	and the total was four on that one.
f0005_us_f0005_00180.wav	of a person's struggle.
f0005_us_f0005_00181.wav	They wanted band integration
f0005_us_f0005_00182.wav	it happens all the time.
f0005_us_f0005_00183.wav	My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister.
f0005_us_f0005_00184.wav	Take a good long look
f0005_us_f0005_00185.wav	But as much as the small stuff stinks
f0005_us_f0005_00186.wav	This is from The Untied States of America.
f0005_us_f0005_00187.wav	we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.
f0005_us_f0005_00188.wav	It's not fair that you can change your height
f0005_us_f0005_00189.wav	Former vice president Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday
f0005_us_f0005_00190.wav	And that love makes us want to be around him
f0005_us_f0005_00191.wav	In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.
f0005_us_f0005_00192.wav	But it's not just in developed nations.
f0005_us_f0005_00193.wav	But what I think comes next is far more interesting.
f0005_us_f0005_00194.wav	what we're out there doing is looking for examples of tools
f0005_us_f0005_00195.wav	They wanted to replace scripture with culture.
f0005_us_f0005_00196.wav	I remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling.
f0005_us_f0005_00197.wav	There's interplay between them.
f0005_us_f0005_00198.wav	What happened was women
f0005_us_f0005_00199.wav	and this is what I looked like by the end.
f0005_us_f0005_00200.wav	or one of the main ones.
f0005_us_f0005_00201.wav	five years old or older
f0005_us_f0005_00202.wav	That material contained only natural signals.
f0005_us_f0005_00203.wav	We transport the wheelchairs everywhere.
f0005_us_f0005_00204.wav	most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.
f0005_us_f0005_00205.wav	And I think fairly soon
f0005_us_f0005_00206.wav	when you met a very poor person
f0005_us_f0005_00207.wav	Most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards.
f0005_us_f0005_00208.wav	My cholesterol went down
f0005_us_f0005_00209.wav	They've passed the wrong legislation.
f0005_us_f0005_00210.wav	discovered percussion.
f0005_us_f0005_00211.wav	And there's a statistic I often like to use
f0005_us_f0005_00212.wav	Yes! We love Splashy Pants.
f0005_us_f0005_00213.wav	And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it.
f0005_us_f0005_00214.wav	We have a serious compression of the curriculum happening out there.
f0005_us_f0005_00215.wav	without the need for further religious superstructure.
f0005_us_f0005_00216.wav	public officials who are out of control
f0005_us_f0005_00217.wav	We need to increase the production.
f0005_us_f0005_00218.wav	Some of it is about walking.
f0005_us_f0005_00219.wav	And that's what art is.
f0005_us_f0005_00220.wav	So to make matters even more difficult
f0005_us_f0005_00221.wav	This is the legacy of manifest destiny.
f0005_us_f0005_00222.wav	If the future  of all human civilization depended on me
f0005_us_f0005_00223.wav	The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people
f0005_us_f0005_00224.wav	when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in
f0005_us_f0005_00225.wav	although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes
f0005_us_f0005_00226.wav	you visit sick people in the hospital
f0005_us_f0005_00227.wav	The extra amount that disappeared last fall  was equivalent to this much.
f0005_us_f0005_00228.wav	my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that
f0005_us_f0005_00229.wav	But if it comes for me
f0005_us_f0005_00230.wav	remember that cloning is possible
f0005_us_f0005_00231.wav	We asked people to draw what it was that they saw.
f0005_us_f0005_00232.wav	So it's a wiki project.
f0005_us_f0005_00233.wav	And if you think it's simply because we are not interested
f0005_us_f0005_00234.wav	The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big
f0005_us_f0005_00235.wav	Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another.
f0005_us_f0005_00236.wav	So I'm here to tell you that we have a problem with boys
f0005_us_f0005_00237.wav	It took quite many years for the program to become what it is now.
f0005_us_f0005_00238.wav	and find the true source  of so many disabilities in children.
f0005_us_f0005_00239.wav	we can give ourselves a gift.
f0005_us_f0005_00240.wav	Whenever I visit the site of the mass grave at Wounded Knee
f0005_us_f0005_00241.wav	This was just out of interest in doing something cool.
f0005_us_f0005_00242.wav	We know that if we have a damaged hip
f0005_us_f0005_00243.wav	this is actually a key to happiness for me
f0005_us_f0005_00244.wav	Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society
f0005_us_f0005_00245.wav	Let's start with the hobbies.
f0005_us_f0005_00246.wav	And as I wondered what he was up to
f0005_us_f0005_00247.wav	we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.
f0005_us_f0005_00248.wav	and I molded it and I cast it in resin
f0005_us_f0005_00249.wav	And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.
f0005_us_f0005_00250.wav	There is one really big problem with this.
f0005_us_f0005_00251.wav	Your vision is larger than our appetite.
f0005_us_f0005_00252.wav	which is the intuitive.
f0005_us_f0005_00253.wav	That's what happened with my dad.
f0005_us_f0005_00254.wav	So here's the modalities that we put together.
f0005_us_f0005_00255.wav	When I look back now from this high hill of my old age
f0005_us_f0005_00256.wav	And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
f0005_us_f0005_00257.wav	we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things.
f0005_us_f0005_00258.wav	The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay
f0005_us_f0005_00259.wav	and thus use a lot of stuff.
f0005_us_f0005_00260.wav	I will see you through this.
f0005_us_f0005_00261.wav	finger on the trigger.
f0005_us_f0005_00262.wav	and they're playing World of Warcraft.
f0005_us_f0005_00263.wav	but I'm going to give you a little preview of what you can expect.
f0005_us_f0005_00264.wav	They have often been rejected by their families
f0005_us_f0005_00265.wav	And we also suck in messages from everything from the television
f0005_us_f0005_00266.wav	It is easier than you think.
f0005_us_f0005_00267.wav	They were tired of ghost dances.
f0005_us_f0005_00268.wav	I know what it is to suffer
f0005_us_f0005_00269.wav	about a fifth of a second later
f0005_us_f0005_00270.wav	And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one
f0005_us_f0005_00271.wav	I'll still be able to be mobile.
f0005_us_f0005_00272.wav	I would feel the abdomen.
f0005_us_f0005_00273.wav	Outside your door the world is waiting.
f0005_us_f0005_00274.wav	But then she was confident again.
f0005_us_f0005_00275.wav	Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
f0005_us_f0005_00276.wav	and they're shipped to Seattle.
f0005_us_f0005_00277.wav	I have a stake in these
f0005_us_f0005_00278.wav	And that is so deeply important to us.
f0005_us_f0005_00279.wav	So this is what I looked like by the end.
f0005_us_f0005_00280.wav	in a travel industry in any way
f0005_us_f0005_00281.wav	built the society that we now live in.
f0005_us_f0005_00282.wav	Because I have three young kids
f0005_us_f0005_00283.wav	We found it was moving in really weird ways.
f0005_us_f0005_00284.wav	if you have a building that doesn't need to be heated with a furnace
f0005_us_f0005_00285.wav	if you look at it in cross-section
f0005_us_f0005_00286.wav	They get scared to walk around.
f0005_us_f0005_00287.wav	And each neuron itself is largely unique.
f0005_us_f0005_00288.wav	Kindergarten teacher I know
f0005_us_f0005_00289.wav	the Drawing On the Right Side of the Brain lady
f0005_us_f0005_00290.wav	I never had met someone with such a hard life
f0005_us_f0005_00291.wav	You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists
f0005_us_f0005_00292.wav	They get scared to move.
f0005_us_f0005_00293.wav	It's about the values behind the words
f0005_us_f0005_00294.wav	The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early
f0005_us_f0005_00295.wav	There was massive flooding in Indonesia.
f0005_us_f0005_00296.wav	they're not to be completely dismissed.
f0005_us_f0005_00297.wav	These are hugely powerful forces That define what we want
f0005_us_f0005_00298.wav	We are a global organization.
f0005_us_f0005_00299.wav	And the incredible thing was she really meant it.
f0005_us_f0005_00300.wav	technically it's actually about Greenpeace
f0005_us_f0005_00301.wav	Scraps of men do not exist.
f0005_us_f0005_00302.wav	New models for pedagogy for the displaced.
f0005_us_f0005_00303.wav	if you meet someone at the bottom of society
f0005_us_f0005_00304.wav	And I've never seen them.
f0005_us_f0005_00305.wav	But her suffering is equal to mine.
f0005_us_f0005_00306.wav	achieved renown in some field.
f0005_us_f0005_00307.wav	one eight-year-old said
f0005_us_f0005_00308.wav	We heat them with sunshine.
f0005_us_f0005_00309.wav	he knows what paperwork looks like.
f0005_us_f0005_00310.wav	Now I am a firm believer in justice.
f0005_us_f0005_00311.wav	which is greatly more effective.
f0005_us_f0005_00312.wav	they will grow up around the mines
f0005_us_f0005_00313.wav	Storm trooper costumes.
f0005_us_f0005_00314.wav	And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.
f0005_us_f0005_00315.wav	There's two spheres and they're separated in distance.
f0005_us_f0005_00316.wav	so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
f0005_us_f0005_00317.wav	There are plenty of countries at war like Afghanistan.
f0005_us_f0005_00318.wav	what artists do is to measure.
f0005_us_f0005_00319.wav	Jacques Dembois told me about.
f0005_us_f0005_00320.wav	They're killing themselves while we watch them die.
f0005_us_f0005_00321.wav	And politicians always talk about justice.
f0005_us_f0005_00322.wav	And so we measured its motion.
f0005_us_f0005_00323.wav	they are willing to accord us
f0005_us_f0005_00324.wav	And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig
f0005_us_f0005_00325.wav	So we sent our lab technician out.
f0005_us_f0005_00326.wav	all alone in the elevator
f0005_us_f0005_00327.wav	And this particular painting
f0005_us_f0005_00328.wav	my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant.
f0005_us_f0005_00329.wav	What are we going to do about it
f0005_us_f0005_00330.wav	and I'm going to start with materials.
f0005_us_f0005_00331.wav	Boy comes home from school
f0005_us_f0005_00332.wav	By the end of this year
f0005_us_f0005_00333.wav	they have a history of dancing with machines.
f0005_us_f0005_00334.wav	And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.
f0005_us_f0005_00335.wav	such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.
f0005_us_f0005_00336.wav	many of which have been brought about by technology.
f0005_us_f0005_00337.wav	winning my college scholarship
f0005_us_f0005_00338.wav	The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're going to die.
f0005_us_f0005_00339.wav	He took my master Falcon pattern
f0005_us_f0005_00340.wav	They wanted us to make use of the space.
f0005_us_f0005_00341.wav	She just had a feeling for math
f0005_us_f0005_00342.wav	And I think that is the message of tragedy to us
f0005_us_f0005_00343.wav	What are we going to do with these boys
f0005_us_f0005_00344.wav	It tells you the what
f0005_us_f0005_00345.wav	and wrote it in plain English.
f0005_us_f0005_00346.wav	but it needs a little help to do it.
f0005_us_f0005_00347.wav	The market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this.
f0005_us_f0005_00348.wav	deposited in the ground as coal
f0005_us_f0005_00349.wav	so I decided to let the whole thing grow
f0005_us_f0005_00350.wav	I was able to scan the picture
f0005_us_f0005_00351.wav	barely able to feed themselves
f0005_us_f0005_00352.wav	No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.
f0005_us_f0005_00353.wav	The developing countries are now following us  and accelerating their pace.
f0005_us_f0005_00354.wav	But I very much believe that that's true.
f0005_us_f0005_00355.wav	If you want to go quickly
f0005_us_f0005_00356.wav	This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
f0005_us_f0005_00357.wav	It's perhaps harder than ever before
f0005_us_f0005_00358.wav	I can't believe in the doctrines.
f0005_us_f0005_00359.wav	But could you go a little further
f0005_us_f0005_00360.wav	in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.
f0005_us_f0005_00361.wav	the big numbers of people who get it
f0005_us_f0005_00362.wav	and Aicha will now tell you how that came about.
f0005_us_f0005_00363.wav	And when they teach us a lesson
f0005_us_f0005_00364.wav	which you may have seen on stage yesterday.
f0005_us_f0005_00365.wav	the more things my hands know how to do
f0005_us_f0005_00366.wav	This is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
f0005_us_f0005_00367.wav	even more access suffused into spaces.
f0005_us_f0005_00368.wav	when you think of glass
f0005_us_f0005_00369.wav	how do you start something like that
f0005_us_f0005_00370.wav	That's what she tells them.
f0005_us_f0005_00371.wav	it's a very young planet.
f0005_us_f0005_00372.wav	It included an exterior loading dock.
f0005_us_f0005_00373.wav	High-voltage DC currents.
f0005_us_f0005_00374.wav	So I'd like to draw a little car here.
f0005_us_f0005_00375.wav	when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools
f0005_us_f0005_00376.wav	Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.
f0005_us_f0005_00377.wav	Thou shall not stereotype.
f0005_us_f0005_00378.wav	But they also own their failure.
f0005_us_f0005_00379.wav	that's a great design.
f0005_us_f0005_00380.wav	to be curious and imaginative
f0005_us_f0005_00381.wav	and she gave me a cover story.
f0005_us_f0005_00382.wav	we can actually do that.
f0005_us_f0005_00383.wav	The flows have increased.
f0005_us_f0005_00384.wav	You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.
f0005_us_f0005_00385.wav	and they're gambling online all night long
f0005_us_f0005_00386.wav	They were tired of sacred hills.
f0005_us_f0005_00387.wav	We went in and sat down at the booth
f0005_us_f0005_00388.wav	Russian nuclear launch key.
f0005_us_f0005_00389.wav	These are investments that pay for themselves.
f0005_us_f0005_00390.wav	Not quite the whole truth.
f0005_us_f0005_00391.wav	We should all look at the Moon a bit more often.
f0005_us_f0005_00392.wav	so should the machine get grander in its process.
f0005_us_f0005_00393.wav	And if you took an ultrasound of that area
f0005_us_f0005_00394.wav	another world's here.
f0005_us_f0005_00395.wav	What matters is that my hands know how to do it.
f0005_us_f0005_00396.wav	Now we are not there yet
f0005_us_f0005_00397.wav	but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.
f0005_us_f0005_00398.wav	I asked people to draw a sheep facing to the left.
f0005_us_f0005_00399.wav	The problem with treaties is they allow tribes to exist as sovereign nations
f0005_us_f0005_00400.wav	I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
f0005_us_f0005_00401.wav	the Mujahideen took all Afghanistan.
f0005_us_f0005_00402.wav	So when I saw the Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago
f0005_us_f0005_00403.wav	I wouldn't be telling you this story if it wasn't compelling.
f0005_us_f0005_00404.wav	small to large is relevant here.
f0005_us_f0005_00405.wav	which promotes stability and democracy and human rights
f0005_us_f0005_00406.wav	Received very favorably by business.
f0005_us_f0005_00407.wav	or whatever it is that they get.
f0005_us_f0005_00408.wav	And it's really clear
f0005_us_f0005_00409.wav	There are words that we're truly afraid of.
f0005_us_f0005_00410.wav	So that's why I decided to tell my story
f0005_us_f0005_00411.wav	It's a great source of stem cells.
f0005_us_f0005_00412.wav	we're less burdened by the presence of it.
f0005_us_f0005_00413.wav	It's a very exciting twist ending
f0005_us_f0005_00414.wav	And people were making some amazing things.
f0005_us_f0005_00415.wav	they're very non-uniformly distributed.
f0005_us_f0005_00416.wav	We're in the driving seat.
f0005_us_f0005_00417.wav	in the analysis of a sociologist  like Emil Durkheim
f0005_us_f0005_00418.wav	This is called Queen's Day.
f0005_us_f0005_00419.wav	And she's got a very large house.
f0005_us_f0005_00420.wav	There is adversity and challenge in life
f0005_us_f0005_00421.wav	They just think of good ideas.
f0005_us_f0005_00422.wav	I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative.
f0005_us_f0005_00423.wav	because those are just orgies of germs.
f0005_us_f0005_00424.wav	Physical therapies can be done
f0005_us_f0005_00425.wav	The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.
f0005_us_f0005_00426.wav	similar actually to the one that the soldier that's come back from Iraq .
f0005_us_f0005_00427.wav	Twentieth century a little bit over two percent.
f0005_us_f0005_00428.wav	And so button by button
f0005_us_f0005_00429.wav	This was the worst month of my life.
f0005_us_f0005_00430.wav	Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
f0005_us_f0005_00431.wav	I have been trying to tell this story for a long time.
f0005_us_f0005_00432.wav	I had to put on sunscreen.
f0005_us_f0005_00433.wav	especially in the developing world
f0005_us_f0005_00434.wav	You can take patients who are less sick
f0005_us_f0005_00435.wav	They're selling us shoes and cars.
f0005_us_f0005_00436.wav	I was giving a talk about two months ago
f0005_us_f0005_00437.wav	I would like to tell you a story
f0005_us_f0005_00438.wav	and a handful of other developed countries
f0005_us_f0005_00439.wav	in which case it's all truth and beauty.
f0005_us_f0005_00440.wav	Those of you who are good at branding
m0001_us_m0001_00001.wav	and people who say they take the Bible literally
m0001_us_m0001_00002.wav	and cost enormous amounts of money.
m0001_us_m0001_00003.wav	and why it causes this anxiety
m0001_us_m0001_00004.wav	We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity
m0001_us_m0001_00005.wav	news creators is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters
m0001_us_m0001_00006.wav	This used to be a bipartisan issue
m0001_us_m0001_00007.wav	setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans.
m0001_us_m0001_00008.wav	so I don't feel the need.
m0001_us_m0001_00009.wav	And if that thing is good
m0001_us_m0001_00010.wav	Bill McDonough covered that last night
m0001_us_m0001_00011.wav	put reliable stuff last
m0001_us_m0001_00012.wav	What is it that we're afraid that this young man is going to do with this gun
m0001_us_m0001_00013.wav	think about organized religions.
m0001_us_m0001_00014.wav	it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.
m0001_us_m0001_00015.wav	And when we take out the U.S.
m0001_us_m0001_00016.wav	you will do that because you are guided to do that.
m0001_us_m0001_00017.wav	and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer.
m0001_us_m0001_00018.wav	Now it's a little extreme
m0001_us_m0001_00019.wav	I just think that's a pretty cool picture.
m0001_us_m0001_00020.wav	A plan to put America back to work
m0001_us_m0001_00021.wav	There must be some call to action.
m0001_us_m0001_00022.wav	Here's the updated version of this entry.
m0001_us_m0001_00023.wav	the healthiest person alive.
m0001_us_m0001_00024.wav	the right to own property
m0001_us_m0001_00025.wav	And that is how stethoscope and auscultation was born.
m0001_us_m0001_00026.wav	maybe they'll drop at the same speed.
m0001_us_m0001_00027.wav	This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.
m0001_us_m0001_00028.wav	and that was unhealthy.
m0001_us_m0001_00029.wav	what is she telling you to write
m0001_us_m0001_00030.wav	There's one more part to the story.
m0001_us_m0001_00031.wav	including the Greeks and the Romans
m0001_us_m0001_00032.wav	about loving your neighbor
m0001_us_m0001_00033.wav	and we are not darkened.
m0001_us_m0001_00034.wav	And also these very life-like
m0001_us_m0001_00035.wav	So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-away
m0001_us_m0001_00036.wav	I had a reasonable skull
m0001_us_m0001_00037.wav	These are the bones left after the best meat has been taken.
m0001_us_m0001_00038.wav	This is Vancouver's propaganda about how green a city they are.
m0001_us_m0001_00039.wav	It won't be up for long.
m0001_us_m0001_00040.wav	I was also in the orthopedic center
m0001_us_m0001_00041.wav	I don't think these doctrines are right.
m0001_us_m0001_00042.wav	There are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies.
m0001_us_m0001_00043.wav	in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you
m0001_us_m0001_00044.wav	We have the manufacture of the car
m0001_us_m0001_00045.wav	they wanted it in one shot.
m0001_us_m0001_00046.wav	and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them
m0001_us_m0001_00047.wav	one apple feeds one man
m0001_us_m0001_00048.wav	we substitute in our lives access to the things we want.
m0001_us_m0001_00049.wav	Things should be as simple as possible
m0001_us_m0001_00050.wav	Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate
m0001_us_m0001_00051.wav	is particularly rapid in its melting.
m0001_us_m0001_00052.wav	to restrictions on school internet use.
m0001_us_m0001_00053.wav	who went up and down this country delivering sermons
m0001_us_m0001_00054.wav	The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side.
m0001_us_m0001_00055.wav	and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time
m0001_us_m0001_00056.wav	You have to focus on it.
m0001_us_m0001_00057.wav	so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.
m0001_us_m0001_00058.wav	This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love.
m0001_us_m0001_00059.wav	So the outer part of that brain is the neocortex.
m0001_us_m0001_00060.wav	so I'll have a disclaimer there.
m0001_us_m0001_00061.wav	this glacier is the  source of drinking water for this city.
m0001_us_m0001_00062.wav	So where does that leave us
m0001_us_m0001_00063.wav	and your brain can be broken into two parts.
m0001_us_m0001_00064.wav	as a reference to when computers became human.
m0001_us_m0001_00065.wav	And as we heard last night
m0001_us_m0001_00066.wav	You get access to distance medicine.
m0001_us_m0001_00067.wav	So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way.
m0001_us_m0001_00068.wav	But there's a bunch of different styles.
m0001_us_m0001_00069.wav	kids are naturally curious about what they don't know
m0001_us_m0001_00070.wav	think of how that might feel.
m0001_us_m0001_00071.wav	Sometimes you see them
m0001_us_m0001_00072.wav	and on the other hand
m0001_us_m0001_00073.wav	vertebrae by vertebrae
m0001_us_m0001_00074.wav	where people simply stop driving as much
m0001_us_m0001_00075.wav	and something happened.
m0001_us_m0001_00076.wav	The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded
m0001_us_m0001_00077.wav	And that creates the front page.
m0001_us_m0001_00078.wav	There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time.
m0001_us_m0001_00079.wav	I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.
m0001_us_m0001_00080.wav	And I feel that we have a special connection
m0001_us_m0001_00081.wav	and that is a huge barrier on a Native reservation.
m0001_us_m0001_00082.wav	The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult
m0001_us_m0001_00083.wav	and workers keep their pay.
m0001_us_m0001_00084.wav	I don't know if any of you have seen the movie City of God
m0001_us_m0001_00085.wav	We will be an overwhelmingly urban species.
m0001_us_m0001_00086.wav	which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.
m0001_us_m0001_00087.wav	But it got me thinking
m0001_us_m0001_00088.wav	which are very much in the Bible as well.
m0001_us_m0001_00089.wav	If we can invent materials
m0001_us_m0001_00090.wav	But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries.
m0001_us_m0001_00091.wav	about a million years ago
m0001_us_m0001_00092.wav	In ways that haven't happened before.
m0001_us_m0001_00093.wav	About a half million people visit every day.
m0001_us_m0001_00094.wav	You see a lot more structure there.
m0001_us_m0001_00095.wav	certain ideas would immediately come to mind.
m0001_us_m0001_00096.wav	was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce
m0001_us_m0001_00097.wav	what you'll see is the video playing above.
m0001_us_m0001_00098.wav	we're often told that we live in very materialistic times
m0001_us_m0001_00099.wav	I update the slide show every time I give it.
m0001_us_m0001_00100.wav	And that nice thing is called meritocracy.
m0001_us_m0001_00101.wav	Amazing!  The machinery is kind of loud.
m0001_us_m0001_00102.wav	I want to know what to teach him.
m0001_us_m0001_00103.wav	It was the easiest way.
m0001_us_m0001_00104.wav	and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.
m0001_us_m0001_00105.wav	to be able to contribute.
m0001_us_m0001_00106.wav	because that's a part of health.
m0001_us_m0001_00107.wav	or between male and intersex and female and intersex
m0001_us_m0001_00108.wav	If we do more in a kind of a stupid way
m0001_us_m0001_00109.wav	Which is the authoritarian
m0001_us_m0001_00110.wav	And according to how you answer that question
m0001_us_m0001_00111.wav	but there's a change.
m0001_us_m0001_00112.wav	And according to how you answer that question
m0001_us_m0001_00113.wav	But we need to get to a stage when you're an atheist and someone says
m0001_us_m0001_00114.wav	That all seems like win to me.
m0001_us_m0001_00115.wav	And to explain why this is so
m0001_us_m0001_00116.wav	and where we might go tomorrow
m0001_us_m0001_00117.wav	the number one organ of ridicule nowadays
m0001_us_m0001_00118.wav	for whom nightfall means darkness
m0001_us_m0001_00119.wav	we are called childish
m0001_us_m0001_00120.wav	and these tools are part of what's making it possible.
m0001_us_m0001_00121.wav	You can see areas where normal cell bodies are being stained.
m0001_us_m0001_00122.wav	The own their success.
m0001_us_m0001_00123.wav	Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.
m0001_us_m0001_00124.wav	But it is going to happen in this century.
m0001_us_m0001_00125.wav	Later he renamed it the stethoscope.
m0001_us_m0001_00126.wav	And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.
m0001_us_m0001_00127.wav	MRI or orthopedic consult.
m0001_us_m0001_00128.wav	that's what the research says you should do.
m0001_us_m0001_00129.wav	And from there it's routine.
m0001_us_m0001_00130.wav	it teaches you how to engage in non-violent insurrection and regime change.
m0001_us_m0001_00131.wav	it's also going to make us better people.
m0001_us_m0001_00132.wav	And so this isn't very scalable.
m0001_us_m0001_00133.wav	his mouth crusted with candida that was resistant to the usual medications.
m0001_us_m0001_00134.wav	Something of importance had transpired in the exchange.
m0001_us_m0001_00135.wav	and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo.
m0001_us_m0001_00136.wav	that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.
m0001_us_m0001_00137.wav	It's a conversation about augmentation.
m0001_us_m0001_00138.wav	look like jellyfish legs.
m0001_us_m0001_00139.wav	We have to find more money for game design.
m0001_us_m0001_00140.wav	and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.
m0001_us_m0001_00141.wav	listening to Kevin Kelly
m0001_us_m0001_00142.wav	the human spirit is so receptive
m0001_us_m0001_00143.wav	And it's interesting that Fildes picked this topic.
m0001_us_m0001_00144.wav	at one end of the spectrum of sympathy
m0001_us_m0001_00145.wav	Then I went down and I read several versions
m0001_us_m0001_00146.wav	literally define who you are
m0001_us_m0001_00147.wav	I don't know if he's alive.
m0001_us_m0001_00148.wav	It's very uncomfortable to be on the receiving end of that kind of language.
m0001_us_m0001_00149.wav	But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
m0001_us_m0001_00150.wav	And then this is the silicon thing that I roll over
m0001_us_m0001_00151.wav	and so I don't know a lot of the tricks like
m0001_us_m0001_00152.wav	If we change these things
m0001_us_m0001_00153.wav	And it's how they link together.
m0001_us_m0001_00154.wav	I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
m0001_us_m0001_00155.wav	He's abundant here in America
m0001_us_m0001_00156.wav	When we think about failing in life
m0001_us_m0001_00157.wav	a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis.
m0001_us_m0001_00158.wav	This is a place for girls.
m0001_us_m0001_00159.wav	it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something.
m0001_us_m0001_00160.wav	But something very valuable in that idea
m0001_us_m0001_00161.wav	they talk about nature and nature's God.
m0001_us_m0001_00162.wav	It's actually about humpback whales.
m0001_us_m0001_00163.wav	but we're losing much more than that.
m0001_us_m0001_00164.wav	the right to full citizenship
m0001_us_m0001_00165.wav	Facebook groups were getting created.
m0001_us_m0001_00166.wav	Australia had an election.
m0001_us_m0001_00167.wav	That's a good close-up of that one.
m0001_us_m0001_00168.wav	because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.
m0001_us_m0001_00169.wav	and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.
m0001_us_m0001_00170.wav	If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq war
m0001_us_m0001_00171.wav	And for the first time
m0001_us_m0001_00172.wav	We had the First World War
m0001_us_m0001_00173.wav	The comment of Najmuddin was Mahmoud has something to prove.
m0001_us_m0001_00174.wav	And the poem is called The God Who Only Knows Four Words.
m0001_us_m0001_00175.wav	But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food.
m0001_us_m0001_00176.wav	If you can hand somebody the key to their own power
m0001_us_m0001_00177.wav	not to mention social networking platforms
m0001_us_m0001_00178.wav	what would that be like
m0001_us_m0001_00179.wav	I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia
m0001_us_m0001_00180.wav	So I hoped that he would not come.
m0001_us_m0001_00181.wav	This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries.
m0001_us_m0001_00182.wav	and they fall out of the tracks
m0001_us_m0001_00183.wav	Without the sex part.
m0001_us_m0001_00184.wav	how long they spent drawing it.
m0001_us_m0001_00185.wav	What I think I've been talking about really is success and failure.
m0001_us_m0001_00186.wav	Well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours
m0001_us_m0001_00187.wav	people who are in desperate straits can get this.
m0001_us_m0001_00188.wav	you will become happier
m0001_us_m0001_00189.wav	And the nerves themselves are the ones who are receiving input.
m0001_us_m0001_00190.wav	Once you start down at this very humble level
m0001_us_m0001_00191.wav	We need to look carefully at our zero tolerance policies.
m0001_us_m0001_00192.wav	three degrees above freezing
m0001_us_m0001_00193.wav	The reason for this is incentives.
m0001_us_m0001_00194.wav	represents the pinnacle
m0001_us_m0001_00195.wav	and your hearts must be generous
m0001_us_m0001_00196.wav	We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
m0001_us_m0001_00197.wav	It's by having one world market
m0001_us_m0001_00198.wav	is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression
m0001_us_m0001_00199.wav	We have to go far quickly.
m0001_us_m0001_00200.wav	and that's that large things don't let you get right past them
m0001_us_m0001_00201.wav	at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers.
m0001_us_m0001_00202.wav	Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
m0001_us_m0001_00203.wav	There are very few things
m0001_us_m0001_00204.wav	So in order to tell you about that tension
m0001_us_m0001_00205.wav	slowly week after week his legs were improving.
m0001_us_m0001_00206.wav	but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families.
m0001_us_m0001_00207.wav	And I'd like to run through a few of these today.
m0001_us_m0001_00208.wav	they don't know what they're talking about.
m0001_us_m0001_00209.wav	We need to change the mindset of acceptance in boys in elementary schools.
m0001_us_m0001_00210.wav	which will be over a million.
m0001_us_m0001_00211.wav	our addiction to carbon based fuels
m0001_us_m0001_00212.wav	when I'm in an elevator all alone
m0001_us_m0001_00213.wav	but when expectations are low
m0001_us_m0001_00214.wav	at the director of the NIH
m0001_us_m0001_00215.wav	I knew I didn't have the strength.
m0001_us_m0001_00216.wav	I also love it because it seems to me that the example
m0001_us_m0001_00217.wav	And if we look at our lives
m0001_us_m0001_00218.wav	Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published
m0001_us_m0001_00219.wav	I felt not quite ready for that job.
m0001_us_m0001_00220.wav	you save a whole bunch of money up front.
m0001_us_m0001_00221.wav	Cervical cancer is five times higher than the U.S.
m0001_us_m0001_00222.wav	and dug the geothermal wells
m0001_us_m0001_00223.wav	Which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources.
m0001_us_m0001_00224.wav	Their culture isn't working in schools.
m0001_us_m0001_00225.wav	This happened around Christmas.
m0001_us_m0001_00226.wav	That's why I was there
m0001_us_m0001_00227.wav	you end up using less.
m0001_us_m0001_00228.wav	So what we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip.
m0001_us_m0001_00229.wav	And one of the things I'm most proud of is this agreement for IBM.
m0001_us_m0001_00230.wav	the growth law is the same.
m0001_us_m0001_00231.wav	and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
m0001_us_m0001_00232.wav	transparency and simplicity a national priority.
m0001_us_m0001_00233.wav	We've done away with the caste system.
m0001_us_m0001_00234.wav	This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition
m0001_us_m0001_00235.wav	which really bothers me.
m0001_us_m0001_00236.wav	and the bad at the bottom
m0001_us_m0001_00237.wav	and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air
m0001_us_m0001_00238.wav	so I definitely take my projects seriously.
m0001_us_m0001_00239.wav	I'm a big advocate of changing the light bulbs and buying hybrids
m0001_us_m0001_00240.wav	And he ended up talking to Rick Rubin
m0001_us_m0001_00241.wav	and I began using that
m0001_us_m0001_00242.wav	you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to
m0001_us_m0001_00243.wav	and I began using that
m0001_us_m0001_00244.wav	you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to
m0001_us_m0001_00245.wav	picture of the child's problems.
m0001_us_m0001_00246.wav	Joseph Bell was an extraordinary teacher by all accounts.
m0001_us_m0001_00247.wav	This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London
m0001_us_m0001_00248.wav	a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
m0001_us_m0001_00249.wav	And other people would draw stick figures or smiley faces.
m0001_us_m0001_00250.wav	he looked at his watch
m0001_us_m0001_00251.wav	And we have to change that.
m0001_us_m0001_00252.wav	if you analyze self-help books that are produced  in the world today
m0001_us_m0001_00253.wav	to be envious of the Queen of England.
m0001_us_m0001_00254.wav	You only know if you try it.
m0001_us_m0001_00255.wav	So there was the topiary there.
m0001_us_m0001_00256.wav	he had a secret weapon yesterday
m0001_us_m0001_00257.wav	I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.
m0001_us_m0001_00258.wav	That was the original intent
m0001_us_m0001_00259.wav	The other thing that religions know is we're not just brains
m0001_us_m0001_00260.wav	Religious view says we need calendars
m0001_us_m0001_00261.wav	is to just remember when I came over here
m0001_us_m0001_00262.wav	and talk about what we're looking for
m0001_us_m0001_00263.wav	Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic.
m0001_us_m0001_00264.wav	philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying
m0001_us_m0001_00265.wav	but here's how it works.
m0001_us_m0001_00266.wav	so Chris invited me to tell you about it.
m0001_us_m0001_00267.wav	and it is the place  where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished
m0001_us_m0001_00268.wav	I would pull down the eyelids.
m0001_us_m0001_00269.wav	And I was having fun with it.
m0001_us_m0001_00270.wav	but we have to actively change.
m0001_us_m0001_00271.wav	But the technologies are getting better
m0001_us_m0001_00272.wav	have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery
m0001_us_m0001_00273.wav	that is not an unusual story.
m0001_us_m0001_00274.wav	How should we view the Bible
m0001_us_m0001_00275.wav	blow it up to exactly full size.
m0001_us_m0001_00276.wav	if my mother couldn't understand it
m0001_us_m0001_00277.wav	reweaving the urban fabric that we already have.
m0001_us_m0001_00278.wav	One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream
m0001_us_m0001_00279.wav	of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar
m0001_us_m0001_00280.wav	So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad
m0001_us_m0001_00281.wav	This is a real thing.
m0001_us_m0001_00282.wav	But when they go away
m0001_us_m0001_00283.wav	This is visualizing international communications.
m0001_us_m0001_00284.wav	the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.
m0001_us_m0001_00285.wav	and we were happy to oblige.
m0001_us_m0001_00286.wav	I realized that he was wanting to expose his wicker-basket chest to me.
m0001_us_m0001_00287.wav	That one I followed by default
m0001_us_m0001_00288.wav	but they're very subtle.
m0001_us_m0001_00289.wav	And that's a new way of looking at luxury goods.
m0001_us_m0001_00290.wav	according to some polls
m0001_us_m0001_00291.wav	One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.
m0001_us_m0001_00292.wav	because my son is like he's buried alive.
m0001_us_m0001_00293.wav	we will sink to them.
m0001_us_m0001_00294.wav	but they do show some population variation.
m0001_us_m0001_00295.wav	His hobbies were chess
m0001_us_m0001_00296.wav	and maybe censors that natural curiosity
m0001_us_m0001_00297.wav	You'll see a lot of people in my photographs today
m0001_us_m0001_00298.wav	I was going to become a brain doctor
m0001_us_m0001_00299.wav	a moment when physicians were beginning to look inside the body.
m0001_us_m0001_00300.wav	the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome
m0001_us_m0001_00301.wav	unless repeatedly told otherwise
m0001_us_m0001_00302.wav	they are writing bills that are unintelligible
m0001_us_m0001_00303.wav	whether it's a computer chip
m0001_us_m0001_00304.wav	And this is called The Wilderness Downtown.
m0001_us_m0001_00305.wav	and she has a Y chromosome.
m0001_us_m0001_00306.wav	We must be hand-in-hand and do something together.
m0001_us_m0001_00307.wav	I found other reference.
m0001_us_m0001_00308.wav	It's not the material goods we want.
m0001_us_m0001_00309.wav	represents the blood bandages of the barber surgeon
m0001_us_m0001_00310.wav	reached just one percent.
m0001_us_m0001_00311.wav	you'll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size.
m0001_us_m0001_00312.wav	What did we want from each other
m0001_us_m0001_00313.wav	and I was going to go study law in Beijing
m0001_us_m0001_00314.wav	And there's more and more people on the way.
m0001_us_m0001_00315.wav	Some of you may recognize this.
m0001_us_m0001_00316.wav	This is again showing all the different contributions.
m0001_us_m0001_00317.wav	of course this is my raggedy old thesaurus.
m0001_us_m0001_00318.wav	They don't have existing infrastructure
m0001_us_m0001_00319.wav	really dense and still hold onto their cars
m0001_us_m0001_00320.wav	and had feet turned in
m0001_us_m0001_00321.wav	And this is probably stereotypically what you think of as a boy and a girl.
m0001_us_m0001_00322.wav	there are things for you in religion.
m0001_us_m0001_00323.wav	How many people knew of Lula before today
m0001_us_m0001_00324.wav	and this is truly an unexplored
m0001_us_m0001_00325.wav	And I hated these bands more than anything.
m0001_us_m0001_00326.wav	I think of the great Indian mathematician
m0001_us_m0001_00327.wav	It's that those connections
m0001_us_m0001_00328.wav	I'm an infectious disease physician
m0002_us_m0002_00001.wav	start to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow.
m0002_us_m0002_00002.wav	It's a fabulous city.
m0002_us_m0002_00003.wav	The reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird.
m0002_us_m0002_00004.wav	It turns out to be really difficult.
m0002_us_m0002_00005.wav	What sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from Burntisland
m0002_us_m0002_00006.wav	But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.
m0002_us_m0002_00007.wav	The combined coverage of Russia
m0002_us_m0002_00008.wav	it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy.
m0002_us_m0002_00009.wav	Maybe that's what adversity gives us
m0002_us_m0002_00010.wav	advanced photovaltaics
m0002_us_m0002_00011.wav	What about a great depression
m0002_us_m0002_00012.wav	That's what you'd call a social news website.
m0002_us_m0002_00013.wav	We take that tagged material and we put it on something called a microarray.
m0002_us_m0002_00014.wav	So before going to law school in China I bought a banjo
m0002_us_m0002_00015.wav	The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn't explain itself
m0002_us_m0002_00016.wav	They're killing each other.
m0002_us_m0002_00017.wav	And they tend to be on their own.
m0002_us_m0002_00018.wav	So that took a lot of time.
m0002_us_m0002_00019.wav	That shouldn't be news to any of us.
m0002_us_m0002_00020.wav	so I won't say too much more than that
m0002_us_m0002_00021.wav	we all have lived separate lives.
m0002_us_m0002_00022.wav	So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.
m0002_us_m0002_00023.wav	they're for all of us.
m0002_us_m0002_00024.wav	or impolitely call feeling very bad about yourself.
m0002_us_m0002_00025.wav	This was a randomized trial.
m0002_us_m0002_00026.wav	when I finally grew up
m0002_us_m0002_00027.wav	I think about global health a lot.
m0002_us_m0002_00028.wav	In fact if you look at world history you can see some reasons for optimism.
m0002_us_m0002_00029.wav	distributed music making
m0002_us_m0002_00030.wav	Kids grow up and become adults just like you.
m0002_us_m0002_00031.wav	It was a wonderful experience.
m0002_us_m0002_00032.wav	Which is pretty impressive right
m0002_us_m0002_00033.wav	And my wife thought this was very offensive
m0002_us_m0002_00034.wav	Where is it coming from
m0002_us_m0002_00035.wav	treaties broken and massacres disguised as battles.
m0002_us_m0002_00036.wav	flip side of this study
m0002_us_m0002_00037.wav	Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.
m0002_us_m0002_00038.wav	Most people have cooking fires in the world
m0002_us_m0002_00039.wav	and they read my son bedtime stories.
m0002_us_m0002_00040.wav	this is the most Medals of Honor ever awarded for a single battle.
m0002_us_m0002_00041.wav	and the other is a condenser.
m0002_us_m0002_00042.wav	Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust
m0002_us_m0002_00043.wav	a truth about the human character.
m0002_us_m0002_00044.wav	Like many autistic children
m0002_us_m0002_00045.wav	I did have a really big epiphany around the situation
m0002_us_m0002_00046.wav	that we're all greedy people.
m0002_us_m0002_00047.wav	because I had nothing else to do.
m0002_us_m0002_00048.wav	we're in fact setting ourselves up not to solve it.
m0002_us_m0002_00049.wav	But when people learned what her son was accused of
m0002_us_m0002_00050.wav	There's new things happening.
m0002_us_m0002_00051.wav	We're finding that people can share the same spaces
m0002_us_m0002_00052.wav	all politicians on left and right
m0002_us_m0002_00053.wav	after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer
m0002_us_m0002_00054.wav	And that was the the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.
m0002_us_m0002_00055.wav	So what can scientists learn about this data
m0002_us_m0002_00056.wav	So they answered my emails.
m0002_us_m0002_00057.wav	to increase the density of the communities around us.
m0002_us_m0002_00058.wav	crossing the front line.
m0002_us_m0002_00059.wav	He got dementia anyway.
m0002_us_m0002_00060.wav	India is coming on line.
m0002_us_m0002_00061.wav	it allows you to highlight individual structures.
m0002_us_m0002_00062.wav	The second thing is tools for collaboration
m0002_us_m0002_00063.wav	I'd like to kick off by looking at education.
m0002_us_m0002_00064.wav	thank you so much for letting me speak.
m0002_us_m0002_00065.wav	And I just thought it'd be wonderful
m0002_us_m0002_00066.wav	You're hearing a person's life.
m0002_us_m0002_00067.wav	But Jefferson wasn't quite right
m0002_us_m0002_00068.wav	and this is the bronze I got back.
m0002_us_m0002_00069.wav	because that lowers the blood pressure.
m0002_us_m0002_00070.wav	without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart.
m0002_us_m0002_00071.wav	you can only imagine how much more he would discern.
m0002_us_m0002_00072.wav	a very famous painting.
m0002_us_m0002_00073.wav	in the Declaration of Independence
m0002_us_m0002_00074.wav	He has regained his full dignity thanks to that job.
m0002_us_m0002_00075.wav	we can have cities that are not only zero emissions
m0002_us_m0002_00076.wav	hopefully for a good cause
m0002_us_m0002_00077.wav	I did not know then how much was ended.
m0002_us_m0002_00078.wav	and that was a really radical thing to do.
m0002_us_m0002_00079.wav	Let's take a look at the Great Depression.
m0002_us_m0002_00080.wav	skipping the whole landline stage.
m0002_us_m0002_00081.wav	we can do some very specific things.
m0002_us_m0002_00082.wav	I need your help on this.
m0002_us_m0002_00083.wav	That image reminded me of something.
m0002_us_m0002_00084.wav	in which case he's allowed to live.
m0002_us_m0002_00085.wav	All we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist
m0002_us_m0002_00086.wav	The best AI in the planet would find it complex and confusing
m0002_us_m0002_00087.wav	So we need to design better games.
m0002_us_m0002_00088.wav	One thing you can do is not treat.
m0002_us_m0002_00089.wav	and not put themselves at risk.
m0002_us_m0002_00090.wav	There's my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon
m0002_us_m0002_00091.wav	and much more expensive to treat.
m0002_us_m0002_00092.wav	regimes become oppressive when they're fearful about keeping control.
m0002_us_m0002_00093.wav	So now on to something completely different.
m0002_us_m0002_00094.wav	I had all the topology I needed  to replicate the Maltese Falcon.
m0002_us_m0002_00095.wav	you've got the tabloid newspaper.
m0002_us_m0002_00096.wav	which ends up getting a little bit crazy.
m0002_us_m0002_00097.wav	They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.
m0002_us_m0002_00098.wav	have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.
m0002_us_m0002_00099.wav	The idea behind leapfrogging is that if you are a person
m0002_us_m0002_00100.wav	What you just heard is Skylife by David Balakrishnan.
m0002_us_m0002_00101.wav	My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life
m0002_us_m0002_00102.wav	living on a planet where their cities also steal the future
m0002_us_m0002_00103.wav	how to mandate simplicity.
m0002_us_m0002_00104.wav	is hydrogen-generating algae.
m0002_us_m0002_00105.wav	As he who lights his candle at mine receives light without darkening me.
m0002_us_m0002_00106.wav	They're very inspiring leaders
m0002_us_m0002_00107.wav	Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us
m0002_us_m0002_00108.wav	because of what I'm talking about.
m0002_us_m0002_00109.wav	the rest was lost in a fire.
m0002_us_m0002_00110.wav	but since I have an expensive computer here
m0002_us_m0002_00111.wav	It's keeping me standing.
m0002_us_m0002_00112.wav	The human ability to adapt
m0002_us_m0002_00113.wav	and on either side of the Indian subcontinent
m0002_us_m0002_00114.wav	Redditors responded and all agreed.
m0002_us_m0002_00115.wav	are still the actual prototype.
m0002_us_m0002_00116.wav	And really you do the same thing.
m0002_us_m0002_00117.wav	I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
m0002_us_m0002_00118.wav	It's also an idea that we have forgotten.
m0002_us_m0002_00119.wav	a wise media theorist Tweeted
m0002_us_m0002_00120.wav	Somebody who doesn't care about your achievements.
m0002_us_m0002_00121.wav	it feels natural to us now.
m0002_us_m0002_00122.wav	This is a completely unsustainable pattern.
m0002_us_m0002_00123.wav	We don't know yet how to build a society which is environmentally sustainable
m0002_us_m0002_00124.wav	It was a man in a wheelchair desperately trying to move away.
m0002_us_m0002_00125.wav	This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
m0002_us_m0002_00126.wav	It's come full circle.
m0002_us_m0002_00127.wav	If you go look at their website today
m0002_us_m0002_00128.wav	Reduce emissions in your home.
m0002_us_m0002_00129.wav	And when my ritual began
m0002_us_m0002_00130.wav	And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six.
m0002_us_m0002_00131.wav	We will never get to grade them.
m0002_us_m0002_00132.wav	really big close-up of the little piece of metal.
m0002_us_m0002_00133.wav	Doesn't look quite the same size
m0002_us_m0002_00134.wav	and they've welcomed me like family.
m0002_us_m0002_00135.wav	who you can see has meat vision.
m0002_us_m0002_00136.wav	unless he's willing to submit to a sex change
m0002_us_m0002_00137.wav	The Wounded Knee massacre is considered the end of the Indian wars.
m0002_us_m0002_00138.wav	When we go to the physician today
m0002_us_m0002_00139.wav	and therefore we will seed that lawn
m0002_us_m0002_00140.wav	You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.
m0002_us_m0002_00141.wav	it's not the strongest of the species that survives
m0002_us_m0002_00142.wav	She is raised as a girl.
m0002_us_m0002_00143.wav	we get a unique fingerprint
m0002_us_m0002_00144.wav	what would my caregivers do with me
m0002_us_m0002_00145.wav	And these are the ultimate literalists.
m0002_us_m0002_00146.wav	the worship of something transcendent.
m0002_us_m0002_00147.wav	please tell him that it was a mistake.
m0002_us_m0002_00148.wav	so I figured I had to address it.
m0002_us_m0002_00149.wav	because we are the leaders of tomorrow
m0002_us_m0002_00150.wav	I'm a big fan of Conan Doyle.
m0002_us_m0002_00151.wav	so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.
m0002_us_m0002_00152.wav	And then he sat down.
m0002_us_m0002_00153.wav	I was probably being a little extreme.
m0002_us_m0002_00154.wav	we can use materials.
m0002_us_m0002_00155.wav	be described as a loser.
m0002_us_m0002_00156.wav	and we see these genes turned on there.
m0002_us_m0002_00157.wav	if you haven't noticed from my skin color
m0002_us_m0002_00158.wav	So if you look at the little script here
m0002_us_m0002_00159.wav	But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.
m0002_us_m0002_00160.wav	then we are truly using our power well.
m0002_us_m0002_00161.wav	Who else can I meet that I don't know
m0002_us_m0002_00162.wav	A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy.
m0002_us_m0002_00163.wav	So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more.
m0002_us_m0002_00164.wav	trying to bring boys back into a space that is comfortable for them.
m0002_us_m0002_00165.wav	thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.
m0002_us_m0002_00166.wav	we have an interesting situation on our hands.
m0002_us_m0002_00167.wav	We have secularized badly
m0002_us_m0002_00168.wav	using cells to do most of the work.
m0002_us_m0002_00169.wav	Alright what about problems
m0002_us_m0002_00170.wav	And the CAT scan revealed no blood clots in the lung
m0002_us_m0002_00171.wav	Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say.
m0002_us_m0002_00172.wav	You may recognize these two guys.
m0002_us_m0002_00173.wav	I know they were sexist
m0002_us_m0002_00174.wav	We knew that many more patients could not come
m0002_us_m0002_00175.wav	we heal ourselves in a natural process
m0002_us_m0002_00176.wav	One more mind will be unlocked.
m0002_us_m0002_00177.wav	is that it turns the whole world  into a school.
m0002_us_m0002_00178.wav	The first is cellular therapies.
m0002_us_m0002_00179.wav	and where the flowers turn red you don't step.
m0002_us_m0002_00180.wav	green power spread throughout the world.
m0002_us_m0002_00181.wav	but it doesn't tell you the where.
m0002_us_m0002_00182.wav	constant acceleration.
m0002_us_m0002_00183.wav	and from Western Europe to the Arctic
m0002_us_m0002_00184.wav	Are there men around that table
m0002_us_m0002_00185.wav	not only commercial skills
m0002_us_m0002_00186.wav	We're going to then apply one of those stains to it
m0002_us_m0002_00187.wav	Greenpeace actually wasn't that crazy about it
m0002_us_m0002_00188.wav	by the end of the day
m0002_us_m0002_00189.wav	is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human.
m0002_us_m0002_00190.wav	Then we sat in a circle with support
m0002_us_m0002_00191.wav	He was coming every day
m0002_us_m0002_00192.wav	how should you feel about the statistics of today
m0002_us_m0002_00193.wav	you are such a strong
m0002_us_m0002_00194.wav	to be even a little bit more dangerous
m0002_us_m0002_00195.wav	I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
m0002_us_m0002_00196.wav	And the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops.
m0002_us_m0002_00197.wav	Is any of this your responsibility today
m0002_us_m0002_00198.wav	at various points call us children.
m0002_us_m0002_00199.wav	And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.
m0002_us_m0002_00200.wav	if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment
m0002_us_m0002_00201.wav	that it gets brighter the more you don't use.
m0002_us_m0002_00202.wav	And Mahmoud put on his prostheses
m0002_us_m0002_00203.wav	the car didn't flip over
m0002_us_m0002_00204.wav	So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
m0002_us_m0002_00205.wav	All the major religions give us calendars.
m0002_us_m0002_00206.wav	while this society is
m0002_us_m0002_00207.wav	the Chinese equivalency exam
m0002_us_m0002_00208.wav	our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully
m0002_us_m0002_00209.wav	because if you listen to dermatologists
m0002_us_m0002_00210.wav	I ran it through my simplicity lab
m0002_us_m0002_00211.wav	Next came the successful Civil Rights movement
m0002_us_m0002_00212.wav	They understood her breast cancer at the molecular level
m0002_us_m0002_00213.wav	and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable
m0002_us_m0002_00214.wav	And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
m0002_us_m0002_00215.wav	that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe
m0002_us_m0002_00216.wav	Tennessee to make a record.
m0002_us_m0002_00217.wav	So this isn't finished at all
m0002_us_m0002_00218.wav	And the thing about a successful life
m0002_us_m0002_00219.wav	it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts
m0002_us_m0002_00220.wav	consistent and useful
m0002_us_m0002_00221.wav	It's going to be a pretty crowded place
m0002_us_m0002_00222.wav	it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
m0002_us_m0002_00223.wav	is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
m0002_us_m0002_00224.wav	second superpower stuff et cetera
m0002_us_m0002_00225.wav	This was from Nature Magazine.
m0002_us_m0002_00226.wav	This is the year of the Wounded Knee Massacre.
m0002_us_m0002_00227.wav	And so we tend to worship ourselves.
m0002_us_m0002_00228.wav	If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy
m0002_us_m0002_00229.wav	I remember so many patients
m0002_us_m0002_00230.wav	made a big commotion over Tipper.
m0002_us_m0002_00231.wav	I loved to write from the age of four
m0002_us_m0002_00232.wav	says the religious world view.
m0002_us_m0002_00233.wav	but by learning it this way
m0002_us_m0002_00234.wav	it's possible that if we injected more mothers into this concept
m0002_us_m0002_00235.wav	They're probably less cell dense.
m0002_us_m0002_00236.wav	we need to look somewhere else for the solution.
m0002_us_m0002_00237.wav	You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
m0002_us_m0002_00238.wav	So I don't have time to play the entire thing for you
m0002_us_m0002_00239.wav	Do you think your bank is going to show that to people
m0002_us_m0002_00240.wav	Many publishers were not quite so encouraging.
m0002_us_m0002_00241.wav	then her hand shall be cut off.
m0002_us_m0002_00242.wav	We need to start doing things like Lula
m0002_us_m0002_00243.wav	There's the phrase called cafeteria religion
m0002_us_m0002_00244.wav	I had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk
m0002_us_m0002_00245.wav	It means that we extended cooperation across national boundaries.
m0002_us_m0002_00246.wav	So if anyone wants to join
m0002_us_m0002_00247.wav	And only one figure remained in the middle of the road.
m0002_us_m0002_00248.wav	And the conversation would go something like this
m0002_us_m0002_00249.wav	It really impairs cognition.
m0002_us_m0002_00250.wav	And the only purpose that these legs can serve
m0002_us_m0002_00251.wav	They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars
m0002_us_m0002_00252.wav	comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality.
m0002_us_m0002_00253.wav	full of contradictions
m0002_us_m0002_00254.wav	It may be possible that we are not even able to build that much clean energy.
m0002_us_m0002_00255.wav	you have to group together
m0002_us_m0002_00256.wav	I have been blown away by this conference
m0002_us_m0002_00257.wav	found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare.
m0002_us_m0002_00258.wav	My dad was a bilingual college professor.
m0002_us_m0002_00259.wav	they have a clear identity
m0002_us_m0002_00260.wav	According to the treaty
m0002_us_m0002_00261.wav	That's exhilarating if you're doing well
m0002_us_m0002_00262.wav	but they really have missed an essential point
m0002_us_m0002_00263.wav	the ones who will bring this world forward.
m0002_us_m0002_00264.wav	I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit
m0002_us_m0002_00265.wav	And as a general term
m0002_us_m0002_00266.wav	The ammonia was toxic.
m0002_us_m0002_00267.wav	don't have time to go into all of them.
m0002_us_m0002_00268.wav	There's some basic things that you would want to understand.
m0002_us_m0002_00269.wav	That's how I hailed taxi-cabs.
m0002_us_m0002_00270.wav	This one was very unexpected because
m0002_us_m0002_00271.wav	who's a very charming man.
m0002_us_m0002_00272.wav	and it's exactly done as it should be
m0002_us_m0002_00273.wav	imagine imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.S.
m0002_us_m0002_00274.wav	notice that we can move those triangles down like this
m0002_us_m0002_00275.wav	There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.
m0002_us_m0002_00276.wav	which divided peoples and nations.
m0002_us_m0002_00277.wav	because they were not stupid people at all.
m0002_us_m0002_00278.wav	advising people how they could live.
m0002_us_m0002_00279.wav	for those of you who don't know
m0002_us_m0002_00280.wav	We're looking right there in the center.
m0002_us_m0002_00281.wav	So if I can save one of the young girls
m0002_us_m0002_00282.wav	you'd have said this.
m0002_us_m0002_00283.wav	We could just re-label things.
m0002_us_m0002_00284.wav	who talk about gaming
m0002_us_m0002_00285.wav	Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.
m0002_us_m0002_00286.wav	But first you need to know two things about me.
m0002_us_m0002_00287.wav	Well if larger markets increase the incentive to produce new ideas
m0002_us_m0002_00288.wav	Ruby Bridges helped end segregation in the United States
m0002_us_m0002_00289.wav	it's that we don't know how to treat it.
m0002_us_m0002_00290.wav	although I think it ought to work the other way around
m0002_us_m0002_00291.wav	which I think is a pretty cool concept
m0002_us_m0002_00292.wav	A whole YouTube channel of people submitting really interesting content.
m0002_us_m0002_00293.wav	And we're not exactly sure why that happens.
m0002_us_m0002_00294.wav	And when we change our behavior in our daily lives
m0002_us_m0002_00295.wav	to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
m0002_us_m0002_00296.wav	They're glorified drill and practice.
m0002_us_m0002_00297.wav	consider making your business carbon neutral.
m0002_us_m0002_00298.wav	because we love our children.
m0002_us_m0002_00299.wav	And it's as easy as shooting fish in a barrel.
m0002_us_m0002_00300.wav	because I couldn't afford the one on eBay.
m0002_us_m0002_00301.wav	something or the other.
m0002_us_m0002_00302.wav	even if I have to crawl on the ground.
m0002_us_m0002_00303.wav	So we can't tell much from just making the ball drop there
m0002_us_m0002_00304.wav	serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself.
m0002_us_m0002_00305.wav	And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
m0002_us_m0002_00306.wav	You can't have it all.
m0002_us_m0002_00307.wav	at the end of the bypass operation
m0002_us_m0002_00308.wav	We've had a different approach.
m0002_us_m0002_00309.wav	How dare we be optimistic
m0002_us_m0002_00310.wav	Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
m0002_us_m0002_00311.wav	They don't just give us books or words about this.
m0002_us_m0002_00312.wav	they did a great job.
m0002_us_m0002_00313.wav	This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
m0002_us_m0002_00314.wav	This is the Kniphausen Hawk.
m0002_us_m0002_00315.wav	And it is important that we recognize that women still need help in school
m0002_us_m0002_00316.wav	At the end of a really rousing paragraph
m0002_us_m0002_00317.wav	wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world.
m0002_us_m0002_00318.wav	The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically.
m0002_us_m0002_00319.wav	somewhere in that process
m0002_us_m0002_00320.wav	but it's an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate.
m0002_us_m0002_00321.wav	The third one took five more
m0002_us_m0002_00322.wav	We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low-vapor pressures.
m0002_us_m0002_00323.wav	I then proceeded to tell the patient
m0002_us_m0002_00324.wav	and we started talking about exactly what it would look like.
m0002_us_m0002_00325.wav	Four guys dancing on treadmills
m0002_us_m0002_00326.wav	And he insisted on beautiful music.
m0002_us_m0002_00327.wav	may be closer to hand than we think.
m0002_us_m0002_00328.wav	why wouldn't you want to fly too
m0002_us_m0002_00329.wav	Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.
m0002_us_m0002_00330.wav	until we approach New Year's Eve
m0002_us_m0002_00331.wav	It's an online music video for the Arcade Fire.
m0002_us_m0002_00332.wav	an animation is a series of images.
m0002_us_m0002_00333.wav	then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here.
m0002_us_m0002_00334.wav	we are quite similar.
m0002_us_m0002_00335.wav	Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S.
m0002_us_m0002_00336.wav	she looks like a girl.
m0002_us_m0002_00337.wav	Now when you add all those things together
m0002_us_m0002_00338.wav	thank you Shakespeare
m0002_us_m0002_00339.wav	And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.
m0002_us_m0002_00340.wav	But as soon as the fighting intensified
m0002_us_m0002_00341.wav	As payment for the Black Hills
m0002_us_m0002_00342.wav	Some of it's transportation access.
m0002_us_m0002_00343.wav	as I mentioned before
m0002_us_m0002_00344.wav	see this wheel's heading here
m0002_us_m0002_00345.wav	until during the middle of the night
m0002_us_m0002_00346.wav	We're certainly going to be looking at more.
m0002_us_m0002_00347.wav	How do you judge people based on the content of character
m0002_us_m0002_00348.wav	Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
m0002_us_m0002_00349.wav	they'll re-grow their fingertip.
m0002_us_m0002_00350.wav	They don't have the depth
m0002_us_m0002_00351.wav	we kids still dream about perfection.
m0002_us_m0002_00352.wav	We made a music video for one of my favorite bands
m0002_us_m0002_00353.wav	years after we're gone.
m0002_us_m0002_00354.wav	I decided to dive in head first
m0002_us_m0002_00355.wav	Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring.
m0002_us_m0002_00356.wav	You change your behavior
m0002_us_m0002_00357.wav	who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer.
m0003_us_m0003_00001.wav	I'm not suggesting that we need to be allowing guns and knives into school.
m0003_us_m0003_00002.wav	with my active involvement
m0003_us_m0003_00003.wav	At the other end of the spectrum you've got tragedy and tragic art.
m0003_us_m0003_00004.wav	at the top you see new lakes
m0003_us_m0003_00005.wav	It's really dangerous.
m0003_us_m0003_00006.wav	You let it cool to room temperature
m0003_us_m0003_00007.wav	They argued with my wife for me
m0003_us_m0003_00008.wav	But we are now in a new era of neuroscience
m0003_us_m0003_00009.wav	and anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing.
m0003_us_m0003_00010.wav	They come everyday to see if the center will open.
m0003_us_m0003_00011.wav	This is what that sounded like.
m0003_us_m0003_00012.wav	This is looking at ascending versus descending flights.
m0003_us_m0003_00013.wav	It's not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today.
m0003_us_m0003_00014.wav	And I get a little object here
m0003_us_m0003_00015.wav	Are you ready to make the match
m0003_us_m0003_00016.wav	And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition.
m0003_us_m0003_00017.wav	And so while planning is important
m0003_us_m0003_00018.wav	which a few  years ago were glaciers.
m0003_us_m0003_00019.wav	how are we going to change the world
m0003_us_m0003_00020.wav	That's going to spray cells over that area.
m0003_us_m0003_00021.wav	So how do we operationalize the question of content of character
m0003_us_m0003_00022.wav	I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.
m0003_us_m0003_00023.wav	There is a real problem with snobbery.
m0003_us_m0003_00024.wav	We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.
m0003_us_m0003_00025.wav	The gun that you see there sprays cells.
m0003_us_m0003_00026.wav	eventually the airport actually flips directions.
m0003_us_m0003_00027.wav	And it's a very hard line to make.
m0003_us_m0003_00028.wav	the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.
m0003_us_m0003_00029.wav	That's a bit of a revelation for nine-year-olds.
m0003_us_m0003_00030.wav	And I wanted to read you this one closing passage about one patient.
m0003_us_m0003_00031.wav	This is a town  in Newfoundland.
m0003_us_m0003_00032.wav	Now is there any alternative to this
m0003_us_m0003_00033.wav	I've always liked to draw
m0003_us_m0003_00034.wav	be they systems of collaboration
m0003_us_m0003_00035.wav	a person should be tried fairly and punished.
m0003_us_m0003_00036.wav	Not for the sake of our health
m0003_us_m0003_00037.wav	as we've heard earlier this week
m0003_us_m0003_00038.wav	through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville
m0003_us_m0003_00039.wav	And this is matched in every industrialized
m0003_us_m0003_00040.wav	Chris and I were really amazed by the potential now with modern web browsers
m0003_us_m0003_00041.wav	which is an oxymoron.
m0003_us_m0003_00042.wav	then I'll achieve the end of this exercise.
m0003_us_m0003_00043.wav	They've slept with the wrong person.
m0003_us_m0003_00044.wav	We have other things to do.
m0003_us_m0003_00045.wav	And that's show here in the the very light blue.
m0003_us_m0003_00046.wav	the results were startling.
m0003_us_m0003_00047.wav	So I've got to do gaming
m0003_us_m0003_00048.wav	He was later killed while in custody.
m0003_us_m0003_00049.wav	and even if given a modicum of support
m0003_us_m0003_00050.wav	What we need is another hero generation.
m0003_us_m0003_00051.wav	We signal the passage of a life with rituals.
m0003_us_m0003_00052.wav	we needed somewhere to start
m0003_us_m0003_00053.wav	And you can pick a style.
m0003_us_m0003_00054.wav	We need to make sure that people see that we need more men in the classroom.
m0003_us_m0003_00055.wav	and the manufacturing costs are low.
m0003_us_m0003_00056.wav	But this isn't about Reddit.
m0003_us_m0003_00057.wav	Such red clay is not found within a hundred miles of Edinburgh
m0003_us_m0003_00058.wav	Now let's go to young children.
m0003_us_m0003_00059.wav	If you're somebody who drives
m0003_us_m0003_00060.wav	agree that meritocracy is a great thing
m0003_us_m0003_00061.wav	This is one way to do it.
m0003_us_m0003_00062.wav	I decided to work on the spirit.
m0003_us_m0003_00063.wav	She does this with cardboard
m0003_us_m0003_00064.wav	where it transmitted because of a very vague concept of birthright.
m0003_us_m0003_00065.wav	Suppose that there are two diseases.
m0003_us_m0003_00066.wav	But I understood he wanted to tell me something.
m0003_us_m0003_00067.wav	Those kinds of studies require much larger populations.
m0003_us_m0003_00068.wav	I went to the dark side
m0003_us_m0003_00069.wav	It was made out of resin
m0003_us_m0003_00070.wav	And it's visualizing SMS messages being sent in the city of Amsterdam.
m0003_us_m0003_00071.wav	Genes send the instructions to make proteins.
m0003_us_m0003_00072.wav	Let's rebrand global warming
m0003_us_m0003_00073.wav	we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.
m0003_us_m0003_00074.wav	What do you want to write about
m0003_us_m0003_00075.wav	but they did it for us
m0003_us_m0003_00076.wav	to opposite of a snob is your mother.
m0003_us_m0003_00077.wav	And men are much more likely to have their significant other
m0003_us_m0003_00078.wav	for which there's relatively little that can be done.
m0003_us_m0003_00079.wav	and why it's so very very important
m0003_us_m0003_00080.wav	So I created this drawing tool.
m0003_us_m0003_00081.wav	that somebody figures out something's up here.
m0003_us_m0003_00082.wav	Here's more good news.
m0003_us_m0003_00083.wav	if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass
m0003_us_m0003_00084.wav	And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
m0003_us_m0003_00085.wav	but it also is pretty wide open.
m0003_us_m0003_00086.wav	But it was really interesting
m0003_us_m0003_00087.wav	And I started collecting sheep.
m0003_us_m0003_00088.wav	You may think I'm wrong in this.
m0003_us_m0003_00089.wav	and I wrote down every single law that I could find.
m0003_us_m0003_00090.wav	When he saw me on what turned out to be his last hours on this earth
m0003_us_m0003_00091.wav	I was so inspired by that story.
m0003_us_m0003_00092.wav	This was no small feat
m0003_us_m0003_00093.wav	even space itself is turning into a service.
m0003_us_m0003_00094.wav	so I won't dwell on that too much.
m0003_us_m0003_00095.wav	the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions
m0003_us_m0003_00096.wav	We recognize them in relation to corporations.
m0003_us_m0003_00097.wav	I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it.
m0003_us_m0003_00098.wav	vote it down if they don't.
m0003_us_m0003_00099.wav	This is the streets of Kabul in those days.
m0003_us_m0003_00100.wav	And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.
m0003_us_m0003_00101.wav	is that the things we need are close by.
m0003_us_m0003_00102.wav	because I believe we have the capacity
m0003_us_m0003_00103.wav	largely from developing countries.
m0003_us_m0003_00104.wav	a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope.
m0003_us_m0003_00105.wav	So I stopped the car and I went to help.
m0003_us_m0003_00106.wav	And increased growth is going to push up demand for that.
m0003_us_m0003_00107.wav	I made some measurements of her thumb
m0003_us_m0003_00108.wav	and this our new video
m0003_us_m0003_00109.wav	This is the opening frame of the video that we created.
m0003_us_m0003_00110.wav	But what you get out of such an exercise is simple a list of genes.
m0003_us_m0003_00111.wav	Maybe we can see it as change.
m0003_us_m0003_00112.wav	And I think it's a pretty valid question.
m0003_us_m0003_00113.wav	as we begin to look at all that commonality
m0003_us_m0003_00114.wav	You can ration health care.
m0003_us_m0003_00115.wav	we were brought together with several other victims' families.
m0003_us_m0003_00116.wav	he needs help getting dressed
m0003_us_m0003_00117.wav	So any vision of success has to admit what it's losing out on
m0003_us_m0003_00118.wav	or extract materials from a natural environment
m0003_us_m0003_00119.wav	There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.
m0003_us_m0003_00120.wav	I blew all my reference up to full size
m0003_us_m0003_00121.wav	I don't think we are particularly materialistic.
m0003_us_m0003_00122.wav	we're realizing that we don't even need to densify and entire city.
m0003_us_m0003_00123.wav	We should focus in on our ideas.
m0003_us_m0003_00124.wav	And the one critical piece missing is that of the patient.
m0003_us_m0003_00125.wav	One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.
m0003_us_m0003_00126.wav	So the machine would get started
m0003_us_m0003_00127.wav	That's something we can learn from.
m0003_us_m0003_00128.wav	We can design better games.
m0003_us_m0003_00129.wav	We're starting to cover this more and more.
m0003_us_m0003_00130.wav	We have to stop this.
m0003_us_m0003_00131.wav	And if we have another eight billion or seven billion
m0003_us_m0003_00132.wav	are stockpiles of these surplus capacities.
m0003_us_m0003_00133.wav	you ought to go for a visit.
m0003_us_m0003_00134.wav	This is Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen's mechanical chess playing machine.
m0003_us_m0003_00135.wav	Now think what this means.
m0003_us_m0003_00136.wav	In the side-effect profile
m0003_us_m0003_00137.wav	I could do an extraordinarily thorough exam.
m0003_us_m0003_00138.wav	I was thinking about all this.
m0003_us_m0003_00139.wav	really nice gentle sanding surface  and I can get it glass-smooth.
m0003_us_m0003_00140.wav	phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles.
m0003_us_m0003_00141.wav	we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things.
m0003_us_m0003_00142.wav	This is a crowd that does know what it is
m0003_us_m0003_00143.wav	all of these incredibly complicating things
m0003_us_m0003_00144.wav	And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle.
m0003_us_m0003_00145.wav	You can start doing things like
m0003_us_m0003_00146.wav	They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.
m0003_us_m0003_00147.wav	is to think less about the individual body
m0003_us_m0003_00148.wav	You can't be successful at everything.
m0003_us_m0003_00149.wav	and we have a lot to share.
m0003_us_m0003_00150.wav	So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time
m0003_us_m0003_00151.wav	They really did a fantastic job.
m0003_us_m0003_00152.wav	In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.
m0003_us_m0003_00153.wav	we need leapfrogging.
m0003_us_m0003_00154.wav	So the market for  those movies is larger.
m0003_us_m0003_00155.wav	Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything
m0003_us_m0003_00156.wav	We're similar at the genetic level.
m0003_us_m0003_00157.wav	I don't see why we can't have a one-page
m0003_us_m0003_00158.wav	I've got some bad news
m0003_us_m0003_00159.wav	but is a terrific musician.
m0003_us_m0003_00160.wav	you might think of colorful Chihuly designs or maybe Italian vases
m0003_us_m0003_00161.wav	But people were coming.
m0003_us_m0003_00162.wav	A large fraction of those people are in the United States.
m0003_us_m0003_00163.wav	And that's really the spirit of my talk.
m0003_us_m0003_00164.wav	described the following exchange between Bell and his students.
m0003_us_m0003_00165.wav	and what it is we think we're perceiving
m0003_us_m0003_00166.wav	but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.
m0003_us_m0003_00167.wav	They look at their entire genomes
m0003_us_m0003_00168.wav	Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood.
m0003_us_m0003_00169.wav	and I was into my ritual.
m0003_us_m0003_00170.wav	from the alien  to a Splashy
m0003_us_m0003_00171.wav	but they did have a concept of birthright.
m0003_us_m0003_00172.wav	So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.
m0003_us_m0003_00173.wav	this very voluble patient began to quiet down.
m0003_us_m0003_00174.wav	I look a little like Moses
m0003_us_m0003_00175.wav	I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface.
m0003_us_m0003_00176.wav	We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong.
m0003_us_m0003_00177.wav	There have been some very vocal atheists who've pointed out
m0003_us_m0003_00178.wav	even more importantly
m0003_us_m0003_00179.wav	the body doesn't react to the testosterone.
m0003_us_m0003_00180.wav	And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.
m0003_us_m0003_00181.wav	We need Republicans as well.
m0003_us_m0003_00182.wav	Neither of us could skip this ritual
m0003_us_m0003_00183.wav	one that gives you more of the feeling of math
m0003_us_m0003_00184.wav	That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine there being a different
m0003_us_m0003_00185.wav	and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.
m0003_us_m0003_00186.wav	and we made it released as a Google Code project
m0003_us_m0003_00187.wav	every Friday you go to a Mikveh.
m0003_us_m0003_00188.wav	but was a natural mathematician.
m0003_us_m0003_00189.wav	It's every seven days.
m0003_us_m0003_00190.wav	Would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient
m0003_us_m0003_00191.wav	the classic medium of delivery of religions.
m0003_us_m0003_00192.wav	You type in your code
m0003_us_m0003_00193.wav	I had Christian bibles.
m0003_us_m0003_00194.wav	Trade walls began to come tumbling down.
m0003_us_m0003_00195.wav	And so that's where physics was at a few years ago
m0003_us_m0003_00196.wav	and maybe an electric screwdriver.
m0003_us_m0003_00197.wav	This is a representation of your brain
m0003_us_m0003_00198.wav	I talk against violence
m0003_us_m0003_00199.wav	We're making androgen
m0003_us_m0003_00200.wav	a sense of generational mission.
m0003_us_m0003_00201.wav	without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.
m0003_us_m0003_00202.wav	These things actually become cheaper to build than the alternatives.
m0003_us_m0003_00203.wav	I'll go you one stranger than that.
m0003_us_m0003_00204.wav	you can fling these seeds out into the field.
m0003_us_m0003_00205.wav	And put a big tire on him.
m0003_us_m0003_00206.wav	If you're involved in anything that's communal
m0003_us_m0003_00207.wav	some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.
m0003_us_m0003_00208.wav	Are there moms who who've raised boys around that table
m0003_us_m0003_00209.wav	So what happened years afterward
m0003_us_m0003_00210.wav	And that means an increase incentive to do research and development
m0003_us_m0003_00211.wav	When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections
m0003_us_m0003_00212.wav	efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
m0003_us_m0003_00213.wav	and we re-engage boys in their learning
m0003_us_m0003_00214.wav	and think more about those relationships.
m0003_us_m0003_00215.wav	And I see the power of music.
m0003_us_m0003_00216.wav	if they drew a stick figure or a smiley face
m0003_us_m0003_00217.wav	and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.
m0003_us_m0003_00218.wav	You might not know that Conan Doyle went to medical school here in Edinburgh
m0003_us_m0003_00219.wav	I'm mentioning all this
m0003_us_m0003_00220.wav	and I'm going to prove it to you.
m0003_us_m0003_00221.wav	We will provide you with a pair of legs.
m0003_us_m0003_00222.wav	and still quite angry.
m0003_us_m0003_00223.wav	quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.
m0003_us_m0003_00224.wav	I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council.
m0003_us_m0003_00225.wav	doing everything and reporting on the patients.
m0003_us_m0003_00226.wav	we were just mortals sitting together in that light that keeps us here.
m0003_us_m0003_00227.wav	And you can see there they're shopping with their helmets.
m0003_us_m0003_00228.wav	if you don't trust someone
m0003_us_m0003_00229.wav	and the rise of the communist nations.
m0003_us_m0003_00230.wav	So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible.
m0003_us_m0003_00231.wav	If you ever watch a sprinter
m0003_us_m0003_00232.wav	you almost force the institution to give the people a way
m0003_us_m0003_00233.wav	my parents were really supportive.
m0003_us_m0003_00234.wav	global mobilization for renewable energy
m0003_us_m0003_00235.wav	This is the new frontier
m0003_us_m0003_00236.wav	As long as we have a browser
m0003_us_m0003_00237.wav	our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity
m0003_us_m0003_00238.wav	because the amount of things you have to do
m0003_us_m0003_00239.wav	here's the good news.
m0003_us_m0003_00240.wav	It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky.
m0003_us_m0003_00241.wav	We made the world more cooperative.
m0003_us_m0003_00242.wav	And when you start changing
m0003_us_m0003_00243.wav	Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document
m0003_us_m0003_00244.wav	after some acid etching
m0003_us_m0003_00245.wav	but how to care for each other.
m0003_us_m0003_00246.wav	I started taking a look as well at different perimeters
m0003_us_m0003_00247.wav	before the age of about six months
m0003_us_m0003_00248.wav	While that might be a somewhat morbid thought
m0003_us_m0003_00249.wav	This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web.
m0003_us_m0003_00250.wav	Another way that zero tolerance lives itself out is in the writing of boys.
m0003_us_m0003_00251.wav	There's the dodo skeleton folder.
m0003_us_m0003_00252.wav	having a strong social network is so crucial to our health.
m0003_us_m0003_00253.wav	And it was done in Europe.
m0003_us_m0003_00254.wav	once the patient was dressed
m0003_us_m0003_00255.wav	These are commonly prescribed antidepressants.
m0003_us_m0003_00256.wav	and the blue are higher altitudes.
m0003_us_m0003_00257.wav	it's also terrible for your brain.
m0003_us_m0003_00258.wav	I went down to my shop
m0003_us_m0003_00259.wav	and I found that they matched up very well.
m0003_us_m0003_00260.wav	And I have to wonder today
m0003_us_m0003_00261.wav	No one is quite listening hard enough.
m0003_us_m0003_00262.wav	It's a very relaxing vocation.
m0003_us_m0003_00263.wav	So there is a spirit of equality
m0003_us_m0003_00264.wav	make and travel in information about movie props.
m0003_us_m0003_00265.wav	And what does that mean
m0003_us_m0003_00266.wav	to lock yourself inside and say
m0003_us_m0003_00267.wav	Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong.
m0003_us_m0003_00268.wav	then we have to really engage it
m0003_us_m0003_00269.wav	Henry has to wait for all of that
m0003_us_m0003_00270.wav	They're completely crowded together.
m0003_us_m0003_00271.wav	Henry can marry in every state a woman
m0003_us_m0003_00272.wav	I sat down too with goosebumps everywhere.
m0003_us_m0003_00273.wav	and we are running it ourselves.
m0003_us_m0003_00274.wav	rather than giving you tried and true examples.
m0003_us_m0003_00275.wav	And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis.
m0003_us_m0003_00276.wav	And at the end of my talk
m0003_us_m0003_00277.wav	we would still have this crisis.
m0003_us_m0003_00278.wav	When they wrote the Constitution
m0003_us_m0003_00279.wav	they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts
m0003_us_m0003_00280.wav	I do not recommend this at all.
m0003_us_m0003_00281.wav	have shouldered the entire burden of research and development.
m0003_us_m0003_00282.wav	We can't relate to her.
m0003_us_m0003_00283.wav	you could ultimately achieve your final goal.
m0003_us_m0003_00284.wav	Think of it in terms of diabetes
m0003_us_m0003_00285.wav	Now think about religions
m0003_us_m0003_00286.wav	But we should make sure that they are our own.
m0003_us_m0003_00287.wav	but they're really not.
m0003_us_m0003_00288.wav	We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.
m0003_us_m0003_00289.wav	a person who is limited
m0003_us_m0003_00290.wav	I'm trying to become a better person.
m0003_us_m0003_00291.wav	a few bright ideas about technology
m0003_us_m0003_00292.wav	I understood that I was wrong again.
m0003_us_m0003_00293.wav	which was odd for an agnostic.
m0003_us_m0003_00294.wav	Well without thinking
m0003_us_m0003_00295.wav	These aren't schizophrenic individuals
m0003_us_m0003_00296.wav	If an idea is important
m0003_us_m0003_00297.wav	So zooming back out real quick
m0003_us_m0003_00298.wav	and it's getting heavier
m0003_us_m0003_00299.wav	they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality.
m0003_us_m0003_00300.wav	There was no motorcade back there.
m0003_us_m0003_00301.wav	I will support any politician of left and right
m0003_us_m0003_00302.wav	the exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same
m0003_us_m0003_00303.wav	and a few toes in that
m0003_us_m0003_00304.wav	a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past.
m0003_us_m0003_00305.wav	and a couple of years ago I wrote an article called My Outsourced Life
m0003_us_m0003_00306.wav	He who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself
m0003_us_m0003_00307.wav	Education is going to give us
m0003_us_m0003_00308.wav	that's one in six children
m0003_us_m0003_00309.wav	one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income
m0003_us_m0003_00310.wav	as happened in China.
m0003_us_m0003_00311.wav	And here I'll zoom in a little bit.
m0003_us_m0003_00312.wav	What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.
m0003_us_m0003_00313.wav	When HAL's dying at the end of the film he starts singing this song
m0003_us_m0003_00314.wav	when people heard that my son was a victim
m0003_us_m0003_00315.wav	Give back the Black Hills.
m0003_us_m0003_00316.wav	and it's this older man.
m0003_us_m0003_00317.wav	you can run faster than me.
m0003_us_m0003_00318.wav	is born three months prematurely
m0003_us_m0003_00319.wav	Things that are inherently more difficult to treat
m0003_us_m0003_00320.wav	we need to speak the body's language.
m0003_us_m0003_00321.wav	We could not possibly stay indoors
m0003_us_m0003_00322.wav	The other thing about modern society
m0003_us_m0003_00323.wav	which are really starting to take off in the U.S.
m0003_us_m0003_00324.wav	when you want to forget
m0003_us_m0003_00325.wav	We have the capacity to do it.
m0003_us_m0003_00326.wav	I will always be what is called wasichu
m0003_us_m0003_00327.wav	And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.
m0003_us_m0003_00328.wav	your connections to all the things around you
m0003_us_m0003_00329.wav	Now I think it's too easy.
m0003_us_m0003_00330.wav	And if you're an educator in any way
m0003_us_m0003_00331.wav	The narrator's only appeased when he draws a box.
m0003_us_m0003_00332.wav	what you're imbibing is
m0003_us_m0003_00333.wav	So thank you very much.
m0003_us_m0003_00334.wav	they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty
m0003_us_m0003_00335.wav	We signal transitions of power with rituals.
m0003_us_m0003_00336.wav	just as the sun is starting to set
m0003_us_m0003_00337.wav	My dad has Alzheimer's disease.
m0003_us_m0003_00338.wav	And what about the web
m0003_us_m0003_00339.wav	deliver other things as well at the same time
m0003_us_m0003_00340.wav	which is now known as One Laptop Per Child.
m0003_us_m0003_00341.wav	You notice the clay on the soles of her feet.
m0003_us_m0003_00342.wav	shaped my own view of myself as an inherently strong
m0003_us_m0003_00343.wav	except to the extent that the belief  brings about new behavior.
m0003_us_m0003_00344.wav	with a few friends of mine
m0003_us_m0003_00345.wav	Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.
m0003_us_m0003_00346.wav	And I think it's all about being afraid of the other
m0003_us_m0003_00347.wav	but that we're easily fooled.
m0003_us_m0003_00348.wav	And Tate asked Fildes to paint the painting of social importance.
m0003_us_m0003_00349.wav	We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals
m0003_us_m0003_00350.wav	and a second order discrete differential equation.
m0003_us_m0003_00351.wav	But if you're a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September
m0003_us_m0003_00352.wav	a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.
m0004_us_m0004_00001.wav	And juxtaposed against this grid
m0004_us_m0004_00002.wav	April in Kabul is beautiful
m0004_us_m0004_00003.wav	It's a natural process
m0004_us_m0004_00004.wav	We've heard all about this here this week
m0004_us_m0004_00005.wav	And there is some good news to report today.
m0004_us_m0004_00006.wav	giving these prayers of thanksgiving
m0004_us_m0004_00007.wav	We are now in a system where anyone can rise  to any position they please.
m0004_us_m0004_00008.wav	Because the more things that are familiar
m0004_us_m0004_00009.wav	It's not developmentally appropriate
m0004_us_m0004_00010.wav	but really difficult for computers.
m0004_us_m0004_00011.wav	There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn
m0004_us_m0004_00012.wav	some various materials.
m0004_us_m0004_00013.wav	you don't want to see things
m0004_us_m0004_00014.wav	a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees
m0004_us_m0004_00015.wav	So today's reality is that if we get sick
m0004_us_m0004_00016.wav	Well I guess that was just a place for girls
m0004_us_m0004_00017.wav	So they brought out their cannons.
m0004_us_m0004_00018.wav	How can you actually afford to treat patients
m0004_us_m0004_00019.wav	what are these people doing to themselves
m0004_us_m0004_00020.wav	that's what I actually like about Johnny Cash's music as well.
m0004_us_m0004_00021.wav	And you see the faces.
m0004_us_m0004_00022.wav	Now there is another side to this.
m0004_us_m0004_00023.wav	where are people going to find the morality
m0004_us_m0004_00024.wav	This thing was made of resin and it was too light.
m0004_us_m0004_00025.wav	you're not going to listen to me.
m0004_us_m0004_00026.wav	Everyone was very excited about this archeological find
m0004_us_m0004_00027.wav	just staring at me as she walked past.
m0004_us_m0004_00028.wav	but also for walking around.
m0004_us_m0004_00029.wav	Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife's hand
m0004_us_m0004_00030.wav	And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.
m0004_us_m0004_00031.wav	Now we've given up with the idea of sermons.
m0004_us_m0004_00032.wav	so one idea can serve one world
m0004_us_m0004_00033.wav	when we take democracy beyond anatomy
m0004_us_m0004_00034.wav	Here on the right-hand side in the middle you see this one guy writing
m0004_us_m0004_00035.wav	So let's take a look at the brain.
m0004_us_m0004_00036.wav	and are a great example.
m0004_us_m0004_00037.wav	and turn them into Bright Green cities.
m0004_us_m0004_00038.wav	the dialogues of Plato
m0004_us_m0004_00039.wav	age has absolutely nothing to do with it.
m0004_us_m0004_00040.wav	but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.
m0004_us_m0004_00041.wav	The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
m0004_us_m0004_00042.wav	we can use the term intersex for this.
m0004_us_m0004_00043.wav	you get amazing things.
m0004_us_m0004_00044.wav	It's about your own interpretation and doing something different.
m0004_us_m0004_00045.wav	And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
m0004_us_m0004_00046.wav	we're going to run out of future really fast.
m0004_us_m0004_00047.wav	That one's pretty good.
m0004_us_m0004_00048.wav	we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work.
m0004_us_m0004_00049.wav	Inside your heart a voice is calling.
m0004_us_m0004_00050.wav	or we would find each other.
m0004_us_m0004_00051.wav	the one that I ended up with.
m0004_us_m0004_00052.wav	But let's accept the strangeness of some of our ideas.
m0004_us_m0004_00053.wav	A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms
m0004_us_m0004_00054.wav	we can still do one better I think
m0004_us_m0004_00055.wav	And here's a little image of that.
m0004_us_m0004_00056.wav	to bring forth what is within
m0004_us_m0004_00057.wav	I grabbed someone else.
m0004_us_m0004_00058.wav	On the cutting edge today it's new ideas which are driving growth.
m0004_us_m0004_00059.wav	but I had to finish what I had started.
m0004_us_m0004_00060.wav	and how you interact with the government to get your benefits
m0004_us_m0004_00061.wav	they're playing video games
m0004_us_m0004_00062.wav	You've heard that saying.
m0004_us_m0004_00063.wav	where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.
m0004_us_m0004_00064.wav	she didn't get that sympathy.
m0004_us_m0004_00065.wav	The Founding Fathers rejected that idea
m0004_us_m0004_00066.wav	gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.
m0004_us_m0004_00067.wav	Dupont Institute in Wilmington
m0004_us_m0004_00068.wav	So maybe the idea I want to put out there is
m0004_us_m0004_00069.wav	these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug
m0004_us_m0004_00070.wav	and they place it on the table
m0004_us_m0004_00071.wav	When we look at the universities
m0004_us_m0004_00072.wav	And I see my life as a series of experiments.
m0004_us_m0004_00073.wav	I see it not just as a grave for the Lakota or for the Sioux
m0004_us_m0004_00074.wav	If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass
m0004_us_m0004_00075.wav	and the reality of my life
m0004_us_m0004_00076.wav	I say that because these are difficult patients.
m0004_us_m0004_00077.wav	from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.
m0004_us_m0004_00078.wav	But we couldn't create a thousand new teachers this summer to save our life.
m0004_us_m0004_00079.wav	I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
m0004_us_m0004_00080.wav	These are things where genes are turned on in individual cell types.
m0004_us_m0004_00081.wav	You find some interesting content
m0004_us_m0004_00082.wav	We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.
m0004_us_m0004_00083.wav	and how we construct those values.
m0004_us_m0004_00084.wav	But if they are not treated they are equally severe.
m0004_us_m0004_00085.wav	our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insiders' knowledge.
m0004_us_m0004_00086.wav	And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.
m0004_us_m0004_00087.wav	So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
m0004_us_m0004_00088.wav	You tell a teacher that
m0004_us_m0004_00089.wav	And it's actually in the machine.
m0004_us_m0004_00090.wav	we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.
m0004_us_m0004_00091.wav	That was so disappointing.
m0004_us_m0004_00092.wav	So you do vocational training
m0004_us_m0004_00093.wav	There's also neo-biological design
m0004_us_m0004_00094.wav	if I take that material
m0004_us_m0004_00095.wav	Everything can be measured before Wounded Knee and after.
m0004_us_m0004_00096.wav	And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world
m0004_us_m0004_00097.wav	the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.
m0004_us_m0004_00098.wav	This is Google Walking Maps.
m0004_us_m0004_00099.wav	touch the breast mass
m0004_us_m0004_00100.wav	And so if we think about that
m0004_us_m0004_00101.wav	Not so if you're adopting a religious mindset.
m0004_us_m0004_00102.wav	And the gatekeeper told me
m0004_us_m0004_00103.wav	When you know where things are
m0004_us_m0004_00104.wav	the magic treatment and began with me on a course towards wellness
m0004_us_m0004_00105.wav	The picture I'm showing you is of Leopold Auenbrugger who
m0004_us_m0004_00106.wav	So something to think about tonight if you've had a couple.
m0004_us_m0004_00107.wav	this is temporal cortex.
m0004_us_m0004_00108.wav	and the story of the people who made this change possible.
m0004_us_m0004_00109.wav	And the real tragedy was
m0004_us_m0004_00110.wav	we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.
m0004_us_m0004_00111.wav	so they don't get lost in a busy world.
m0004_us_m0004_00112.wav	that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society
m0004_us_m0004_00113.wav	it says that if you smile
m0004_us_m0004_00114.wav	So it's how New York communicates with other international cities.
m0004_us_m0004_00115.wav	and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.
m0004_us_m0004_00116.wav	I don't think we have to make that choice.
m0004_us_m0004_00117.wav	What would you have predicted not knowing this
m0004_us_m0004_00118.wav	or a suburban family donating a box of clothes they don't even want anymore.
m0004_us_m0004_00119.wav	but it was for any kind of patient.
m0004_us_m0004_00120.wav	what you wanted all along.
m0004_us_m0004_00121.wav	I'm not sure why you're laughing.
m0004_us_m0004_00122.wav	
m0004_us_m0004_00123.wav	by magazines and other media outlets
m0004_us_m0004_00124.wav	This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout
m0004_us_m0004_00125.wav	If you had based your prediction
m0004_us_m0004_00126.wav	the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
m0004_us_m0004_00127.wav	and I know that in this group it really is.
m0004_us_m0004_00128.wav	and also making them for myself
m0004_us_m0004_00129.wav	they're processing it.
m0004_us_m0004_00130.wav	We've got to make something better than what we've got.
m0004_us_m0004_00131.wav	that it's not just enough to survive.
m0004_us_m0004_00132.wav	but making that step and then realizing
m0004_us_m0004_00133.wav	There are materials which do this.
m0004_us_m0004_00134.wav	by globalizing the world.
m0004_us_m0004_00135.wav	which are a masculinizing hormone.
m0004_us_m0004_00136.wav	a new era in Native American history began.
m0004_us_m0004_00137.wav	Children's publisher not working with children
m0004_us_m0004_00138.wav	whose story was also covered by ABC News.
m0004_us_m0004_00139.wav	followed by European flights coming in the upper right-hand corner.
m0004_us_m0004_00140.wav	Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
m0004_us_m0004_00141.wav	All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.
m0004_us_m0004_00142.wav	There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency
m0004_us_m0004_00143.wav	is the burning of fossil fuels.
m0004_us_m0004_00144.wav	And this makes many things fun
m0004_us_m0004_00145.wav	I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.
m0004_us_m0004_00146.wav	But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about
m0004_us_m0004_00147.wav	I shout like a true Italian.
m0004_us_m0004_00148.wav	I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished.
m0004_us_m0004_00149.wav	when really the attitude should be reciprocal
m0004_us_m0004_00150.wav	I'll talk about that a little bit.
m0004_us_m0004_00151.wav	except in the botanical gardens.
m0004_us_m0004_00152.wav	in the middle of the night
m0004_us_m0004_00153.wav	this is just my logical side talking.
m0004_us_m0004_00154.wav	government called for a death penalty for him
m0004_us_m0004_00155.wav	where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.
m0004_us_m0004_00156.wav	even though it's a very serious cause
m0004_us_m0004_00157.wav	It's okay to take yourself a little less seriously
m0004_us_m0004_00158.wav	these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice.
m0004_us_m0004_00159.wav	not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.
m0004_us_m0004_00160.wav	i was shorter by three quarters of an inch.
m0004_us_m0004_00161.wav	and often very frightening.
m0004_us_m0004_00162.wav	if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically
m0004_us_m0004_00163.wav	Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.
m0004_us_m0004_00164.wav	the power of music to connect hearts.
m0004_us_m0004_00165.wav	I have more time that I can still move around.
m0004_us_m0004_00166.wav	is our greatest human skill.
m0004_us_m0004_00167.wav	And when you can't relate to somebody
m0004_us_m0004_00168.wav	what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous.
m0004_us_m0004_00169.wav	I listened to the chest.
m0004_us_m0004_00170.wav	We've done all sorts of extraordinary things.
m0004_us_m0004_00171.wav	no matter what ailed you
m0005_us_m0005_00001.wav	and I'm going to make an admission.
m0005_us_m0005_00002.wav	people do what you pay them to do.
m0005_us_m0005_00003.wav	slash our transportation use
m0005_us_m0005_00004.wav	The following is a time-line of treaties made
m0005_us_m0005_00005.wav	You lose your sense of balance
m0005_us_m0005_00006.wav	or what is foreign to them.
m0005_us_m0005_00007.wav	a piano that played itself
m0005_us_m0005_00008.wav	only three actually successfully completed their run.
m0005_us_m0005_00009.wav	This is taking a look at Atlanta.
m0005_us_m0005_00010.wav	It's like beachcombing
m0005_us_m0005_00011.wav	Unless you're David Bolinsky
m0005_us_m0005_00012.wav	which actually  is seen briefly in The Maltese Falcon
m0005_us_m0005_00013.wav	We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.
m0005_us_m0005_00014.wav	There is a carbon calculator.
m0005_us_m0005_00015.wav	One other thing you can do with such a thing is you can
m0005_us_m0005_00016.wav	Four or five opportunities to see the breast masses
m0005_us_m0005_00017.wav	And as a special treat
m0005_us_m0005_00018.wav	They answered my phone.
m0005_us_m0005_00019.wav	Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.
m0005_us_m0005_00020.wav	examined her axilla carefully
m0005_us_m0005_00021.wav	their faces still so clear.
m0005_us_m0005_00022.wav	and we're starting to really kind of crowd source this navigation.
m0005_us_m0005_00023.wav	the first animal to be cloned.
m0005_us_m0005_00024.wav	which is a truly subtle and interesting proof
m0005_us_m0005_00025.wav	And he's going to do that on the Day of Judgement with angels and trumpets
m0005_us_m0005_00026.wav	and it has a lot to do with trust
m0005_us_m0005_00027.wav	But isn't there something bigger than us
m0005_us_m0005_00028.wav	And reading is just about impossible.
m0005_us_m0005_00029.wav	but merited and deserved.
m0005_us_m0005_00030.wav	do stuff with vacant space.
m0005_us_m0005_00031.wav	I'll just do this very quickly.
m0005_us_m0005_00032.wav	we're now mapping into this anatomic framework
m0005_us_m0005_00033.wav	Augustine in The City of God
m0005_us_m0005_00034.wav	as opposed to try the sodding approach.
m0005_us_m0005_00035.wav	a friend of mine that I never actually met
m0005_us_m0005_00036.wav	He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it
m0005_us_m0005_00037.wav	just hanging out with our Grammy.
m0005_us_m0005_00038.wav	And you can also see the way that it was drawn.
m0005_us_m0005_00039.wav	I was going to talk about information ecology.
m0005_us_m0005_00040.wav	as opposed to what I knew it as
m0005_us_m0005_00041.wav	a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.
m0005_us_m0005_00042.wav	I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at
m0005_us_m0005_00043.wav	all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black
m0005_us_m0005_00044.wav	that's especially true in the developed world.
m0005_us_m0005_00045.wav	And I just finished a couple of months ago.
m0005_us_m0005_00046.wav	And out of that sense of failure
m0005_us_m0005_00047.wav	But the political will has to be mobilized in order to mobilize the resources.
m0005_us_m0005_00048.wav	So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense
m0005_us_m0005_00049.wav	But it's going to work.
m0005_us_m0005_00050.wav	that if you come to one of our hospitals missing a limb
m0005_us_m0005_00051.wav	From laughs to tears.
m0005_us_m0005_00052.wav	Nobody calls her disabled.
m0005_us_m0005_00053.wav	we never closed it again.
m0005_us_m0005_00054.wav	They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
m0005_us_m0005_00055.wav	and then we see how it acts
m0005_us_m0005_00056.wav	But when we live in a denser community
m0005_us_m0005_00057.wav	And sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.
m0005_us_m0005_00058.wav	the first thing we need is
m0005_us_m0005_00059.wav	But without having the silicon sock
m0005_us_m0005_00060.wav	You could consider this state boundaries
m0005_us_m0005_00061.wav	nobody's ever seen a particle.
m0005_us_m0005_00062.wav	So we were really excited about working with them.
m0005_us_m0005_00063.wav	transparency and empathy a national priority.
m0005_us_m0005_00064.wav	it actually made it into the bill.
m0005_us_m0005_00065.wav	even at the brain biochemical level
m0005_us_m0005_00066.wav	not only for war victims
m0005_us_m0005_00067.wav	I think that better things are on the way.
m0005_us_m0005_00068.wav	which pumps water as kids play.
m0005_us_m0005_00069.wav	cardiovascular damage.
m0005_us_m0005_00070.wav	because they don't play with car stops
m0005_us_m0005_00071.wav	We've done a really good job struggling with democracy
m0005_us_m0005_00072.wav	We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.
m0005_us_m0005_00073.wav	was the manager of a local foundry.
m0005_us_m0005_00074.wav	You can do it! You can make it! 
m0005_us_m0005_00075.wav	The Bible says that if two men are in a fight
m0005_us_m0005_00076.wav	A lot of computational fluid dynamics.
m0005_us_m0005_00077.wav	but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity
m0005_us_m0005_00078.wav	here's the most recent progression of  Falcons.
m0005_us_m0005_00079.wav	This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.
m0005_us_m0005_00080.wav	Kind of amazing what some people did.
m0005_us_m0005_00081.wav	you can see is almost like blood
m0005_us_m0005_00082.wav	And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff
m0005_us_m0005_00083.wav	This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization.
m0005_us_m0005_00084.wav	So we chose a small spot in the garden.
m0005_us_m0005_00085.wav	She's simply too strange.
m0005_us_m0005_00086.wav	where a man who's sexually attracted to other men is liable to be murdered
m0005_us_m0005_00087.wav	and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.
m0005_us_m0005_00088.wav	He'll sign his name on every line
m0005_us_m0005_00089.wav	It was a strange sensation.
m0005_us_m0005_00090.wav	Now ideas have this amazing property.
m0005_us_m0005_00091.wav	Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent.
m0005_us_m0005_00092.wav	And it was while I was doing my Ph.
m0005_us_m0005_00093.wav	and we try and get the two to take.
m0005_us_m0005_00094.wav	I'm not trying to diminish the impact
m0005_us_m0005_00095.wav	what's the alternative
m0005_us_m0005_00096.wav	They analyze large populations.
m0005_us_m0005_00097.wav	our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility.
m0005_us_m0005_00098.wav	Mahmoud grabbed his son
m0005_us_m0005_00099.wav	and she was brought in confused.
m0005_us_m0005_00100.wav	which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.
m0005_us_m0005_00101.wav	if you hold two fists together
m0005_us_m0005_00102.wav	I think that rituals are
m0005_us_m0005_00103.wav	We see all this complexity.
m0005_us_m0005_00104.wav	we can release the power of so many more children
m0005_us_m0005_00105.wav	It takes its inspiration in form from life.
m0005_us_m0005_00106.wav	If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture
m0005_us_m0005_00107.wav	But they are also very effective in deflecting our path.
m0005_us_m0005_00108.wav	If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing.
m0005_us_m0005_00109.wav	So the technician takes the instructions.
m0005_us_m0005_00110.wav	We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.
m0005_us_m0005_00111.wav	The most popular news sites don't do much better.
m0005_us_m0005_00112.wav	This provides a reason why trade and globalization are even more important
m0005_us_m0005_00113.wav	bridge and writing op-eds.
m0005_us_m0005_00114.wav	whether or not there is a God.
m0005_us_m0005_00115.wav	you can put an artificial hip in.
m0005_us_m0005_00116.wav	but I think very soon will be.
m0005_us_m0005_00117.wav	we never closed a single day.
m0005_us_m0005_00118.wav	you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture
m0005_us_m0005_00119.wav	we tend to seek simple answers.
m0005_us_m0005_00120.wav	We think art is really
m0005_us_m0005_00121.wav	it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion
m0005_us_m0005_00122.wav	So to engage in that conversation with the body
m0005_us_m0005_00123.wav	at moments of great challenge
m0005_us_m0005_00124.wav	I recommend Jim Wallace and Tony Campolo.
m0005_us_m0005_00125.wav	Here's just one example before I close up.
m0005_us_m0005_00126.wav	there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
m0005_us_m0005_00127.wav	because if you spend all that time imagining that conception
m0005_us_m0005_00128.wav	the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself
m0005_us_m0005_00129.wav	efficiency and conservation.
m0005_us_m0005_00130.wav	let me give you an analogy.
m0005_us_m0005_00131.wav	children are the future we send to the future.
m0005_us_m0005_00132.wav	what in the world could be wrong in Washington
m0005_us_m0005_00133.wav	you face a blizzard of paperwork.
m0005_us_m0005_00134.wav	I particularly like the Ganesh in the background
m0005_us_m0005_00135.wav	is cell phones just permeating out through society.
m0005_us_m0005_00136.wav	palpable breast masses
m0005_us_m0005_00137.wav	and I wanted to get published.
m0005_us_m0005_00138.wav	why we're particularly drawn to nature.
m0005_us_m0005_00139.wav	There's me reading the Bible.
m0005_us_m0005_00140.wav	we have that great healthcare system.
m0005_us_m0005_00141.wav	I went to a very fancy party.
m0005_us_m0005_00142.wav	examined both breasts including the axillary tail
m0005_us_m0005_00143.wav	We won't talk about that anymore.
m0005_us_m0005_00144.wav	So we started doing some repairs.
m0005_us_m0005_00145.wav	would the Martians say
m0005_us_m0005_00146.wav	It is estimated that one in six children
m0005_us_m0005_00147.wav	And corporations are very like religions in many ways
m0005_us_m0005_00148.wav	And who are waving their first books in the air
m0005_us_m0005_00149.wav	when you look at the Moon
m0005_us_m0005_00150.wav	But before doing that
m0005_us_m0005_00151.wav	Now a lot of you are probably are familiar with Deb Roy who
m0005_us_m0005_00152.wav	you needed quantum mechanics to describe little
m0005_us_m0005_00153.wav	We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.
m0005_us_m0005_00154.wav	but you first test your mic.
m0005_us_m0005_00155.wav	there's no problem about it.
m0005_us_m0005_00156.wav	To give you a sense of the experience
m0005_us_m0005_00157.wav	This is what it would look like if you went to the site.
m0005_us_m0005_00158.wav	somebody who had not been blessed by fortune
m0005_us_m0005_00159.wav	you went to see the barber surgeon who wound up cupping you
m0005_us_m0005_00160.wav	Mister Splashy Pants.
m0005_us_m0005_00161.wav	by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable .
m0005_us_m0005_00162.wav	if you're not familiar with it already.
m0005_us_m0005_00163.wav	and that our rituals can be sacred.
m0005_us_m0005_00164.wav	How we build things can change as well.
m0005_us_m0005_00165.wav	And now we mechanized that process.
m0005_us_m0005_00166.wav	They've been exposed to this idea of our society
m0005_us_m0005_00167.wav	It's also in terms of race
m0005_us_m0005_00168.wav	you get muscle tremors
m0005_us_m0005_00169.wav	which had nothing to do with detecting rales in the lung
m0005_us_m0005_00170.wav	Participant Productions convened
m0005_us_m0005_00171.wav	what you can see is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.
m0005_us_m0005_00172.wav	and we can't have that.
m0005_us_m0005_00173.wav	but now done minimally invasively
m0005_us_m0005_00174.wav	They had not heard of it but were fascinated by it.
m0005_us_m0005_00175.wav	This is clinically relevant today.
m0005_us_m0005_00176.wav	then went back out to the airport to fly back home.
m0005_us_m0005_00177.wav	But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.
m0005_us_m0005_00178.wav	The treaty seemed to be a complete victory for Red Cloud and the Sioux.
m0005_us_m0005_00179.wav	first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration.
m0005_us_m0005_00180.wav	I don't know if he's tortured.
m0005_us_m0005_00181.wav	And if you're a woman
m0005_us_m0005_00182.wav	And they are described as losers.
m0005_us_m0005_00183.wav	or look at their watch and make their excuses.
m0005_us_m0005_00184.wav	It's to culture that we should look for guidance
m0005_us_m0005_00185.wav	you can start making all sorts of investments.
m0005_us_m0005_00186.wav	truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind.
m0005_us_m0005_00187.wav	There are a lot of great investments that you can make.
m0005_us_m0005_00188.wav	Call Washington! Call Washington! And I thought to myself
m0005_us_m0005_00189.wav	I do history of anatomy.
m0005_us_m0005_00190.wav	so we're actually looking forward to it.
m0005_us_m0005_00191.wav	I asked how to do the greater Ridgeway
m0005_us_m0005_00192.wav	You've seen this slide before
m0005_us_m0005_00193.wav	Nothing should hold you back.
m0005_us_m0005_00194.wav	or what other people perceive as my disability.
m0005_us_m0005_00195.wav	and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.
m0005_us_m0005_00196.wav	All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism
m0005_us_m0005_00197.wav	The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers
m0005_us_m0005_00198.wav	The court determined that
m0005_us_m0005_00199.wav	along with deforestation
m0005_us_m0005_00200.wav	I don't need one of those.
m0005_us_m0005_00201.wav	that's keeping you upright right now.
m0005_us_m0005_00202.wav	When you put it in plain English
m0005_us_m0005_00203.wav	by stealing the future
m0005_us_m0005_00204.wav	getting her subsequent care with her private oncologist.
m0005_us_m0005_00205.wav	Most other societies have had
m0005_us_m0005_00206.wav	That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
m0005_us_m0005_00207.wav	I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.
m0005_us_m0005_00208.wav	I think there is an alternative.
m0005_us_m0005_00209.wav	eliminating a source of food and clothing and shelter for the Sioux.
m0005_us_m0005_00210.wav	This is one of the older tobacco commercials.
m0005_us_m0005_00211.wav	This is a Mapnificent map that show me
m0005_us_m0005_00212.wav	Now remember here what Jefferson said.
m0005_us_m0005_00213.wav	I think this means divine power of the ocean in a Polynesian language.
m0005_us_m0005_00214.wav	The Founding Fathers were
m0005_us_m0005_00215.wav	and they're wiggling toes
m0005_us_m0005_00216.wav	And I'm trying to start it as a movement.
m0005_us_m0005_00217.wav	Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you
m0005_us_m0005_00218.wav	and they're getting faster and faster each time.
m0005_us_m0005_00219.wav	All those things do is change who pays.
m0005_us_m0005_00220.wav	and they are poking and prodding
m0005_us_m0005_00221.wav	It's the greenest building in the world.
m0005_us_m0005_00222.wav	when Anajulina told me
m0005_us_m0005_00223.wav	old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.
m0005_us_m0005_00224.wav	What we actually start with is a medical examiner's office.
m0005_us_m0005_00225.wav	the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie
m0005_us_m0005_00226.wav	Since we're in Edinburgh
m0005_us_m0005_00227.wav	there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels
m0005_us_m0005_00228.wav	tend to be isolated individuals.
m0005_us_m0005_00229.wav	It's as interesting a side-effect as it could be.
m0005_us_m0005_00230.wav	It does depend on all of us
m0005_us_m0005_00231.wav	the other patients did the same
m0005_us_m0005_00232.wav	they get a little bit better.
m0005_us_m0005_00233.wav	the body develops more along the female typical path.
m0005_us_m0005_00234.wav	and I built a big block of it
m0005_us_m0005_00235.wav	This is where all your decision-making processes are going on.
m0005_us_m0005_00236.wav	and the budgets are larger.
m0005_us_m0005_00237.wav	The question is whether we will be.
m0005_us_m0005_00238.wav	You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.
m0005_us_m0005_00239.wav	Behind him there was a child
m0005_us_m0005_00240.wav	which is it's not about the leaves above
m0005_us_m0005_00241.wav	and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
m0005_us_m0005_00242.wav	We are seeking normal human brains.
m0005_us_m0005_00243.wav	went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen
m0005_us_m0005_00244.wav	China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
m0005_us_m0005_00245.wav	Imagine if instead of facing that
m0005_us_m0005_00246.wav	It's now repetition of short
m0005_us_m0005_00247.wav	We can take a movie of what's going on
m0005_us_m0005_00248.wav	we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days
m0005_us_m0005_00249.wav	I have been told that there must be something we can do.
m0005_us_m0005_00250.wav	who was finishing up Johnny Cash's final album called Ain't No Grave.
m0005_us_m0005_00251.wav	because I had to get it back out of the mold.
m0005_us_m0005_00252.wav	which so far I can knit a blob.
m0005_us_m0005_00253.wav	and it's all very real and relative to every single person
m0005_us_m0005_00254.wav	we're seeing more and more people embrace this walkshed life.
m0005_us_m0005_00255.wav	is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.
m0005_us_m0005_00256.wav	then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze.
m0005_us_m0005_00257.wav	This is peak fishing in a few seconds.
m0005_us_m0005_00258.wav	red in the face in an effort to push the father.
m0005_us_m0005_00259.wav	but befriended through some prop deals
m0005_us_m0005_00260.wav	So my view is be optimistic.
m0005_us_m0005_00261.wav	So we put the idea on the back burner for a few months.
m0005_us_m0005_00262.wav	So this was very inspiring to me.
m0005_us_m0005_00263.wav	and I am no exception.
m0005_us_m0005_00264.wav	who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas.
m0005_us_m0005_00265.wav	So we collect this MR.
m0005_us_m0005_00266.wav	what is a meritocratic society
m0005_us_m0005_00267.wav	and the waitress came over
m0005_us_m0005_00268.wav	it's not tuberculosis
m0005_us_m0005_00269.wav	One of the challenges is that the richer we are
m0005_us_m0005_00270.wav	that recycle much of their water
m0005_us_m0005_00271.wav	So let's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk.
m0005_us_m0005_00272.wav	The housing office is unable to build new structures
m0005_us_m0005_00273.wav	This didn't really sit well with my intuition
m0005_us_m0005_00274.wav	to use a wrestling term
m0005_us_m0005_00275.wav	I asked about his son.
m0005_us_m0005_00276.wav	They're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds.
m0005_us_m0005_00277.wav	And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother
m0005_us_m0005_00278.wav	and what seven times seven was.
m0005_us_m0005_00279.wav	That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.
m0005_us_m0005_00280.wav	We're losing a ritual.
m0005_us_m0005_00281.wav	and that involves going through childhood again
m0005_us_m0005_00282.wav	It seemed so intuitive to me.
m0005_us_m0005_00283.wav	in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries
m0005_us_m0005_00284.wav	I had a lot of journalists calling me
m0005_us_m0005_00285.wav	But because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone
m0005_us_m0005_00286.wav	And for that I am very grateful.
m0005_us_m0005_00287.wav	And perhaps most remarkably
m0005_us_m0005_00288.wav	Every single debate has been sponsored by Clean Coal.
m0005_us_m0005_00289.wav	which is totally forgettable.
m0005_us_m0005_00290.wav	so I'm cut off from morality
m0005_us_m0005_00291.wav	And what about terms like over the limit
m0005_us_m0005_00292.wav	was willing to take that leap and trust me
m0005_us_m0005_00293.wav	But also for the newcomers.
m0005_us_m0005_00294.wav	Some of those designs include models for acting
m0005_us_m0005_00295.wav	but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.
m0005_us_m0005_00296.wav	But what I really want to stress is by all means
m0005_us_m0005_00297.wav	certainly the challenge was there.
m0005_us_m0005_00298.wav	This is a good time to look at your feet
m0005_us_m0005_00299.wav	And Najmuddin was staying there
m0005_us_m0005_00300.wav	very primitive cognitive psychology.
m0005_us_m0005_00301.wav	The students should teach their teachers.
m0005_us_m0005_00302.wav	take the Jewish idea of forgiveness.
m0005_us_m0005_00303.wav	And where we are clinically today
m0005_us_m0005_00304.wav	But here there was no sheep-like criteria.
m0005_us_m0005_00305.wav	Video games are not the cause.
m0005_us_m0005_00306.wav	You mean we can shoot a music video without actually using any video
m0005_us_m0005_00307.wav	and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet.
m0005_us_m0005_00308.wav	but an idea can feed the world.
m0005_us_m0005_00309.wav	And as if that wasn't enough
m0005_us_m0005_00310.wav	That is a good thing.
m0005_us_m0005_00311.wav	the museum is gorgeous.
m0005_us_m0005_00312.wav	The others were brothers
m0005_us_m0005_00313.wav	right into the beating heart of the patient.
m0005_us_m0005_00314.wav	and that they stay in one place.
m0005_us_m0005_00315.wav	It's a beautiful idea.
m0005_us_m0005_00316.wav	Mission accomplished.
m0005_us_m0005_00317.wav	I presided over so many scenes like this.
m0005_us_m0005_00318.wav	I got immediate sympathy.
m0005_us_m0005_00319.wav	do you have a couple of words for conclusion
m0005_us_m0005_00320.wav	And they were telling me all the things I had to do.
m0005_us_m0005_00321.wav	is the idea that success
m0005_us_m0005_00322.wav	I actually can put both of them on.
m0005_us_m0005_00323.wav	and he kept falling over.
m0005_us_m0005_00324.wav	So we have a model in potential
m0005_us_m0005_00325.wav	and Hasidic Jews and the Amish.
m0005_us_m0005_00326.wav	And then you'd do your best to recreate that with your own voice.
m0005_us_m0005_00327.wav	but they weren't whale lovers.
m0005_us_m0005_00328.wav	Which brings on another threshold effect I call furnace dumping.
m0005_us_m0005_00329.wav	Otherwise our minds are like sieves.
m0005_us_m0005_00330.wav	the bigger lessons that I learned from my year.
m0005_us_m0005_00331.wav	The iPatient is getting wonderful care all across America.
m0005_us_m0005_00332.wav	when the reality of getting old looks like this
m0005_us_m0005_00333.wav	a book they were enchanted to discover.
m0005_us_m0005_00334.wav	we think of sheep as followers.
m0005_us_m0005_00335.wav	some things that lie beyond the cloud.
m0005_us_m0005_00336.wav	I work for the Red Cross and I'm a physical therapist.
m0005_us_m0005_00337.wav	And so I went back and looked through my Creative Projects folder
m0005_us_m0005_00338.wav	you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis
m0005_us_m0005_00339.wav	she had to go through and pull out all the little plastic guns.
m0005_us_m0005_00340.wav	For this so-called battle
m0005_us_m0005_00341.wav	whatever you think of creationism
m0005_us_m0005_00342.wav	And we have to find a way to create
m0005_us_m0005_00343.wav	They're always talking about that stuff.
m0005_us_m0005_00344.wav	Kean made that shift in thinking.
m0005_us_m0005_00345.wav	The latest figures show that the old model is not working.
m0005_us_m0005_00346.wav	They circle the great truths again and again and again.
m0005_us_m0005_00347.wav	hard truth about their medical prognosis
m0005_us_m0005_00348.wav	And each one of these forces split the world
m0005_us_m0005_00349.wav	invented the printing press
m0005_us_m0005_00350.wav	Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.
m0005_us_m0005_00351.wav	So we have visions like this.
m0005_us_m0005_00352.wav	And it's even cruel to think of anything like this.
m0005_us_m0005_00353.wav	but would miss the point.
m0005_us_m0005_00354.wav	There's a thing that happens when you mold and cast things
m0005_us_m0005_00355.wav	All throughout the developing world
m0005_us_m0005_00356.wav	We'll be showing the video at the end
m0005_us_m0005_00357.wav	And the nearest ferry crossing from Fife is from Burntisland.
m0005_us_m0005_00358.wav	These flows are increasing very rapidly.
m0005_us_m0005_00359.wav	So in Orthodox Jewish communities
m0005_us_m0005_00360.wav	It has a shock absorber in it so it
m0005_us_m0005_00361.wav	the third largest mass of ice
m0005_us_m0005_00362.wav	we're thinking about what we do for each other.
m0005_us_m0005_00363.wav	I am a meritocrat in that sense.
m0005_us_m0005_00364.wav	A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
m0005_us_m0005_00365.wav	We don't tend to do that.
m0005_us_m0005_00366.wav	They were simply told these are the A students
m0005_us_m0005_00367.wav	but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism.
m0005_us_m0005_00368.wav	That clause was obviously ignored.
m0005_us_m0005_00369.wav	before I moved to Stanford.
m0005_us_m0005_00370.wav	And you can basically see that the richer a country is
m0005_us_m0005_00371.wav	They're responsible for this video
m0005_us_m0005_00372.wav	Rituals are terribly important.
m0005_us_m0005_00373.wav	Those events led to a domino effect that has yet to end.
m0005_us_m0005_00374.wav	and our belief in who is responsible for our lives.
m0005_us_m0005_00375.wav	And the longer we live
m0005_us_m0005_00376.wav	they wanted to name it.
m0005_us_m0005_00377.wav	What's the difference between a sermon and our modern
m0005_us_m0005_00378.wav	come dance with me Come dance with me.
m0005_us_m0005_00379.wav	And we were very excited about this because
m0005_us_m0005_00380.wav	It's a little screenshot.
m0005_us_m0005_00381.wav	I was doing something that I was not supposed to do.
m0005_us_m0005_00382.wav	books written by lone individuals
m0005_us_m0005_00383.wav	By the time they're five
m0005_us_m0005_00384.wav	This is why I'm here in front of you.
m0005_us_m0005_00385.wav	I eventually achieved  what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull.
m0005_us_m0005_00386.wav	And I was writing software to visualize laser scanners.
m0005_us_m0005_00387.wav	We've put people on the moon.
m0005_us_m0005_00388.wav	And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one
m0005_us_m0005_00389.wav	At least we can start repairing the prostheses
m0005_us_m0005_00390.wav	But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.
m0005_us_m0005_00391.wav	So let me finish up with some good news
m0005_us_m0005_00392.wav	which if you haven't been there
m0005_us_m0005_00393.wav	This is practically not new to TEDsters.
m0005_us_m0005_00394.wav	There are also these smaller cells as you'll see.
m0005_us_m0005_00395.wav	this is the vasculature
m0005_us_m0005_00396.wav	we don't know what we're made of.
m0005_us_m0005_00397.wav	So the story with Zacarias was too much really.
m0005_us_m0005_00398.wav	It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
m0005_us_m0005_00399.wav	This is when I was in Texas.
m0005_us_m0005_00400.wav	Any time I have an internet connection
m0005_us_m0005_00401.wav	Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet.
m0005_us_m0005_00402.wav	I suffered a lot as a mother.
m0005_us_m0005_00403.wav	In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold
m0005_us_m0005_00404.wav	But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.
m0005_us_m0005_00405.wav	when they first look at a fresh human brain
m0005_us_m0005_00406.wav	And at the end of this three month period
m0005_us_m0005_00407.wav	And they were tired of all the inconveniences of the Sioux.
m0005_us_m0005_00408.wav	and I'll get to why it didn't work
m0005_us_m0005_00409.wav	We're losing a ritual that I believe is transformative
m0005_us_m0005_00410.wav	just some statistics about what we went through in the process.
m0005_us_m0005_00411.wav	By not treating the wholeness of a person
m0005_us_m0005_00412.wav	we don't admit to that.
m0005_us_m0005_00413.wav	I thought I would start with the logo.
m0005_us_m0005_00414.wav	The Pine Ridge Reservation
m0005_us_m0005_00415.wav	So take a look around this auditorium today.
m0005_us_m0005_00416.wav	and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.
m0005_us_m0005_00417.wav	And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist
m0005_us_m0005_00418.wav	There's an old African proverb that some of you know  that says
m0005_us_m0005_00419.wav	And so they wrote down all these observations
m0005_us_m0005_00420.wav	You donate money to a cause
m0005_us_m0005_00421.wav	and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power
m0005_us_m0005_00422.wav	So that was my experience stoning
m0005_us_m0005_00423.wav	that genes are being turned on in a very specific subset of cells.
m0005_us_m0005_00424.wav	but we've completely let ourselves down.
m0005_us_m0005_00425.wav	Forget about messages.
m0005_us_m0005_00426.wav	But Mahmoud and his son were already there.
m0005_us_m0005_00427.wav	And none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
m0005_us_m0005_00428.wav	no! It should be The Incredibles.
m0005_us_m0005_00429.wav	so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that
m0005_us_m0005_00430.wav	I'll just close by saying that the tools are there
m0005_us_m0005_00431.wav	When I saw Aicha in the media
m0005_us_m0005_00432.wav	Now we do this over and over again.
m0005_us_m0005_00433.wav	Local TV news looms large
m0005_us_m0005_00434.wav	We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.
m0005_us_m0005_00435.wav	The real patient often wonders
m0005_us_m0005_00436.wav	we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina
m0005_us_m0005_00437.wav	you find some more shells.
m0005_us_m0005_00438.wav	when we use all these things
m0005_us_m0005_00439.wav	But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art.
m0005_us_m0005_00440.wav	I couldn't disagree more.
m0005_us_m0005_00441.wav	as many of you have suggested.
m0005_us_m0005_00442.wav	and there's nothing in it.
m0005_us_m0005_00443.wav	It's involved in coordinated movement.
m0005_us_m0005_00444.wav	by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby
m0005_us_m0005_00445.wav	you place restrictions on them
m0005_us_m0005_00446.wav	and I can look inside this object.
m0005_us_m0005_00447.wav	Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is
m0005_us_m0005_00448.wav	I'm a political progressive
