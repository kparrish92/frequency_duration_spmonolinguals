	abstract = {Homophone duration in spontaneous speech: A mixed-effects model Susanne Gahl August 2009 i 1. Introduction A recent analysis of a corpus of spontaneous speech (Gahl, 2008) showed that homophone pairs differed in duration as a function of word frequency. For example, the high-frequency word time was shorter on average than its less-frequent homophone twin thyme. This effect persisted when other factors affecting word duration were statistically controlled for in a linear regression model. However, that model had several serious limitations. The goal of the current study is to overcome these limitations and to explore the determinants of word duration further. The model presented in Gahl (2008) was a linear regression model. Its outcome variable was the average duration of the higher-frequency member of the homophone pairs. Predictors were entered into the model in a blockwise fashion, in three separate blocks. The sole predictor in the first block was the average duration of the lower- frequency member of a homophone pair. The second block contained known determinants of word duration in connected speech, such as contextual speaking rate, the probability of a word given neighboring words in an utterance, orthographic regularity, and proximity to pauses. On the third and final block, the frequency of the higher- frequency member of the homophone pair (i.e. the frequency of the word whose duration was to be predicted by the model) was entered, to ascertain whether word frequency was a significant predictor of word duration over and above other known factors. That question has theoretical implications for linguistic and psycholinguistic models of language production, which are discussed in Gahl (2008). The modeling strategy of predicting the average duration of the higher frequency member of the homophone pair (e.g. time) from the lower frequency member (e.g. thyme) is problematic in a number of ways. For one thing, information specific to the lower frequency homophone never entered into the model predictions, except indirectly, via the duration of the lower-frequency homophone. For example, while the orthographic regularity of the high-frequency homophone was a predictor in the model, the orthographic regularity of the lower-frequency homophone was not. This meant that the homophone twin was not a perfect control for the effect of phonemic content on word duration, since the duration of, for example, thyme in part reflect the orthographic regularity of that word. Properties specific to the low-frequency words were never entered into the model. A further problem with the modeling strategy in Gahl (2008) was that information about specific word tokens was lost to the model. All of the predictors in the model represented information about word types, not word tokens. For some variables, this is as it should be. Word frequency, for example, is a property of a word type: The frequency of the word thyme is a property of the word type thyme, not of an individual token. By contrast, whether the word thyme immediately precedes a pause in an utterance, on the other hand, is a property of a specific token of the word. Information about proximity to},

	abstract = {This paper tests whether lemma frequency impacts the duration of homographic noun–verb homophones in spontaneous speech, e.g. cut (n)/cut (v). In earlier research on effects of lemma frequency (e.g. Gahl 2008), these pairs of words were not investigated due to a focus on heterographic homophones. Theories of the mental lexicon in both linguistics and psycholinguistics differ as to whether these word pairs are assumed to have shared or separate lexical representations. An empirical analysis based on spontaneous speech from the Buckeye corpus (Pitt et al. 2007) yields the result that differences in lemma frequency affect the duration of the N/V pairs under investigation. First, this finding provides evidence for N/V pairs having separate representations and thus supports models of the mental lexicon in which lexical entries are specified for word class. Second, the result is at odds with an account of ‘full inheritance’ of frequency across homophones and consequently with speech production models implementing inheritance effects via a shared form representation for homophonous words. The findings are best accounted for in a model that assumes completely separate lexical representations for homophonous words.},

Referencing new developments in cognitive and functional linguistics, phonetics, and connectionist modeling, this book investigates various ways in which a speaker/hearer's experience with language affects the representation of phonology. Rather than assuming phonological representations in terms of phonemes, Joan Bybee adopts an exemplar model, in which specific tokens of use are stored and categorized phonetically with reference to variables in the context. This model allows an account of phonetically gradual sound change which produces lexical variation, and provides an explanatory account of the fact that many reductive sound changes affect high frequency items first. The well-known effects of type and token frequency on morphologically-conditioned phonological alterations are shown also to apply to larger sequences, such as fixed phrases and constructions, solving some of the problems formulated previously as dealing with the phonology-syntax interface.},

	abstract = {Phonological representations capture information about individual word forms and about the general characteristics of word forms in a language. To support the processing of novel word forms as well as familiar word forms in novel contexts, an abstract level of representation is needed in which many phonetic details and contextual features are disregarded. At the same time, evidence has accumulated that such details are retained in memory and used in processing individual words and indexical features of language. Taken together, these results mean that a hybrid model of phonological representation is needed. The abstract level supports generalizations based on lexical type statistics and fast adaptation to communicative requirements through the reuse of existing categories. A richly detailed level of representation is implicated in word-specific phonetic patterns, the detailed dynamics of regular sound changes, and active associations of phonetic patterns with gender, age, and dialect.},
